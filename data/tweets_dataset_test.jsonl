{"text": "Title: Specifying Object Attributes and Relations in Interactive Scene Generation\nAuthors: Oron Ashual, Lior Wolf\nAbstract: We introduce a method for the generation of images from an input scene graph. The method separates between a layout embedding and an appearance embedding. The dual embedding leads to generated images that better match the scene graph, have higher visual quality, and support more complex scene graphs. In addition, the embedding scheme supports multiple and diverse output images per scene graph, which can be further controlled by the user. We demonstrate two modes of per-object control: (i) importing elements from other images, and (ii) navigation in the object space, by selecting an appearance archetype.

{"text": "Title: KVT: k-NN Attention for Boosting Vision Transformers\nAuthors: Pichao Wang, Xue Wang, Fan Wang, Ming Lin, Shuning Chang, Hao Li, Rong Jin\nAbstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have dominated computer vision for years, due to its ability in capturing locality and translation invariance. Recently, many vision transformer architectures have been proposed and they show promising performance. A key component in vision transformers is the fully-connected self-attention which is more powerful than CNNs in modelling long range dependencies. However, since the current dense self-attention uses all image patches (tokens) to compute attention matrix, it may neglect locality of images patches and involve noisy tokens (e.g., clutter background and occlusion), leading to a slow training process and potential degradation of performance. To address these problems, we propose the $k$-NN attention for boosting vision transformers. Specifically, instead of involving all the tokens for attention matrix calculation, we only select the top-$k$ similar tokens from the keys for each query to compute the attention map. The proposed $k$-NN attention naturally inherits the local bias of CNNs without introducing convolutional operations, as nearby tokens tend to be more similar than others. In addition, the $k$-NN attention allows for the exploration of long range correlation and at the same time filters out irrelevant tokens by choosing the most similar tokens from the entire image. Despite its simplicity, we verify, both theoretically and empirically, that $k$-NN attention is powerful in speeding up training and distilling noise from input tokens. Extensive experiments are conducted by using 11 different vision transformer architectures to verify that the proposed $k$-NN attention can work with any existing transformer architectures to improve its prediction performance.

In contrast to the existing literature, our method does not require a pre-scanned personalized mesh template, and thus can be applied to in-the-wild videos. To constrain the output to a valid deformation space, we build statistical deformation models for three types of clothing: T-shirt, short pants and long pants. A differentiable renderer is utilized to align our captured shapes to the input frames by minimizing the difference in both silhouette, segmentation, and texture. We develop a UV texture growing method which expands the visible texture region of the clothing sequentially in order to minimize drift in deformation tracking. We also extract fine-grained wrinkle detail from the input videos by fitting the clothed surface to the normal maps estimated by a convolutional neural network. Our method produces temporally coherent reconstruction of body and clothing from monocular video. We demonstrate successful clothing capture results from a variety of challenging videos. Extensive quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on metrics including body pose error and surface reconstruction error of the clothing.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Title: Learning Neural Light Fields with Ray-Space Embedding Networks\nAuthors: Benjamin Attal, Jia-Bin Huang, Michael Zollhoefer, Johannes Kopf, Changil Kim\nAbstract: Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) produce state-of-the-art view synthesis results. However, they are slow to render, requiring hundreds of network evaluations per pixel to approximate a volume rendering integral. Baking NeRFs into explicit data structures enables efficient rendering, but results in a large increase in memory footprint and, in many cases, a quality reduction. In this paper, we propose a novel neural light field representation that, in contrast, is compact and directly predicts integrated radiance along rays. Our method supports rendering with a single network evaluation per pixel for small baseline light field datasets and can also be applied to larger baselines with only a few evaluations per pixel. At the core of our approach is a ray-space embedding network that maps the 4D ray-space manifold into an intermediate, interpolable latent space. Our method achieves state-of-the-art quality on dense forward-facing datasets such as the Stanford Light Field dataset. In addition, for forward-facing scenes with sparser inputs we achieve results that are competitive with NeRF-based approaches in terms of quality while providing a better speed/quality/memory trade-off with far fewer network evaluations.", "label": 1}

This paper presents a self-supervised method that can be trained on YouTube videos without known depth, which makes training data collection simple and improves the generalization of the learned network. The self-supervised learning is achieved by minimizing a photo-consistency loss, which is evaluated between a video frame and its neighboring frames warped according to the estimated depth and the 3D non-rigid motion of the human body. To solve this non-rigid motion, we first estimate a rough SMPL model at each video frame and compute the non-rigid body motion accordingly, which enables self-supervised learning on estimating the shape details. Experiments demonstrate that our method enjoys better generalization and performs much better on data in the wild.", "label": 1}

The big progress is mainly contributed to the representation ability of transformer and its variant architectures. In this paper, we study the low-level computer vision task (e.g., denoising, super-resolution and deraining) and develop a new pre-trained model, namely, image processing transformer (IPT). To maximally excavate the capability of transformer, we present to utilize the well-known ImageNet benchmark for generating a large amount of corrupted image pairs. The IPT model is trained on these images with multi-heads and multi-tails. In addition, the contrastive learning is introduced for well adapting to different image processing tasks. The pre-trained model can therefore efficiently employed on desired task after fine-tuning. With only one pre-trained model, IPT outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods on various low-level benchmarks.

Given a source product, a target product, and an art style image, our method produces a neural warping field that warps the source shape to imitate the geometric style of the target and a neural texture transformation network that transfers the artistic style to the warped source product. Our model, Industrial Style Transfer (InST), consists of large-scale geometric warping (LGW) and interest-consistency texture transfer (ICTT). LGW aims to explore an unsupervised transformation between the shape masks of the source and target products for fitting large-scale shape warping. Furthermore, we introduce a mask smoothness regularization term to prevent the abrupt changes of the details of the source product. ICTT introduces an interest regularization term to maintain important contents of the warped product when it is stylized by using the art style image. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that InST achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple visual product design tasks, e.g., companies' snail logos and classical bottles (please see Fig. 1).

The identity preservation problem, where the model loses the detailed information of the target leading to a defective output, is the most common failure mode. The problem has several potential sources such as the identity of the driver leaking due to the identity mismatch, or dealing with unseen large poses. To overcome such problems, we introduce components that address the mentioned problem: image attention block, target feature alignment, and landmark transformer. Through attending and warping the relevant features, the proposed architecture, called MarioNETte, produces high-quality reenactments of unseen identities in a few-shot setting. In addition, the landmark transformer dramatically alleviates the identity preservation problem by isolating the expression geometry through landmark disentanglement. Comprehensive experiments are performed to verify that the proposed framework can generate highly realistic faces, outperforming all other baselines, even under a significant mismatch of facial characteristics between the target and the driver.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Title: Meta-Learning to Improve Pre-Training\nAuthors: Aniruddh Raghu, Jonathan Lorraine, Simon Kornblith, Matthew McDermott, David Duvenaud\nAbstract: Pre-training (PT) followed by fine-tuning (FT) is an effective method for training neural networks, and has led to significant performance improvements in many domains. PT can incorporate various design choices such as task and data reweighting strategies, augmentation policies, and noise models, all of which can significantly impact the quality of representations learned. The hyperparameters introduced by these strategies therefore must be tuned appropriately. However, setting the values of these hyperparameters is challenging. Most existing methods either struggle to scale to high dimensions, are too slow and memory-intensive, or cannot be directly applied to the two-stage PT and FT learning process. In this work, we propose an efficient, gradient-based algorithm to meta-learn PT hyperparameters. We formalize the PT hyperparameter optimization problem and propose a novel method to obtain PT hyperparameter gradients by combining implicit differentiation and backpropagation through unrolled optimization. We demonstrate that our method improves predictive performance on two real-world domains. First, we optimize high-dimensional task weighting hyperparameters for multitask pre-training on protein-protein interaction graphs and improve AUROC by up to 3.9%. Second, we optimize a data augmentation neural network for self-supervised PT with SimCLR on electrocardiography data and improve AUROC by up to 1.9%.", "label": 1}

In the pursuit of Green AI, we investigate simple MLP-based architectures. We find that existing architectures such as MLPMixer, which achieves token mixing through a static MLP applied to each feature independently, are too detached from the inductive biases required for natural language understanding. In this paper, we propose a simple variant, HyperMixer, which forms the token mixing MLP dynamically using hypernetworks. Empirically, we demonstrate that our model performs better than alternative MLP-based models, and on par with Transformers. In contrast to Transformers, HyperMixer achieves these results at substantially lower costs in terms of processing time, training data, and hyperparameter tuning.", "label": 1}

Berg, Deepak Pathak\nAbstract: We present Worldsheet, a method for novel view synthesis using just a single RGB image as input. The main insight is that simply shrink-wrapping a planar mesh sheet onto the input image, consistent with the learned intermediate depth, captures underlying geometry sufficient to generate photorealistic unseen views with large viewpoint changes. To operationalize this, we propose a novel differentiable texture sampler that allows our wrapped mesh sheet to be textured and rendered differentiably into an image from a target viewpoint. Our approach is category-agnostic, end-to-end trainable without using any 3D supervision, and requires a single image at test time. We also explore a simple extension by stacking multiple layers of Worldsheets to better handle occlusions. Worldsheet consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on single-image view synthesis across several datasets. Furthermore, this simple idea captures novel views surprisingly well on a wide range of high-resolution in-the-wild images, converting them into navigable 3D pop-ups.

In this work, we present a reinforcement learning framework that takes in sparse signals from an HMD and two controllers, and simulates plausible and physically valid full body motions. Using high quality full body motion as dense supervision during training, a simple policy network can learn to output appropriate torques for the character to balance, walk, and jog, while closely following the input signals. Our results demonstrate surprisingly similar leg motions to ground truth without any observations of the lower body, even when the input is only the 6D transformations of the HMD.

Efros, Tero Karras\nAbstract: We present a video generation model that accurately reproduces object motion, changes in camera viewpoint, and new content that arises over time. Existing video generation methods often fail to produce new content as a function of time while maintaining consistencies expected in real environments, such as plausible dynamics and object persistence. A common failure case is for content to never change due to over-reliance on inductive biases to provide temporal consistency, such as a single latent code that dictates content for the entire video. On the other extreme, without long-term consistency, generated videos may morph unrealistically between different scenes. To address these limitations, we prioritize the time axis by redesigning the temporal latent representation and learning long-term consistency from data by training on longer videos. To this end, we leverage a two-phase training strategy, where we separately train using longer videos at a low resolution and shorter videos at a high resolution. To evaluate the capabilities of our model, we introduce two new benchmark datasets with explicit focus on long-term temporal dynamics.", "label": 1}

Existing approaches typically design an individual network for each modality and/or a specific fusion network for multimodal tasks. To simplify the network architecture, we use a single transformer network and enforce multi-task learning during VL pre-training, which includes the image-text contrastive loss, image-text matching loss, and masked language modeling loss based on the bidirectional and the seq2seq attention mask. The same transformer network is used as the image encoder, the text encoder, or the fusion network in different pre-training tasks. Empirically, we observe less conflict among different tasks and achieve new state of the arts on visual question answering, COCO image captioning (cross-entropy optimization) and nocaps (in SPICE).

The proposed ClarET is applicable to a wide range of event-centric reasoning scenarios, considering its versatility of (i) event-correlation types (e.g., causal, temporal, contrast), (ii) application formulations (i.e., generation and classification), and (iii) reasoning types (e.g., abductive, counterfactual and ending reasoning).

While we have witnessed great progress in image deblurring in recent years, most methods require significant computational power and have limitations in processing high-resolution photos with severe local motions. To this end, we develop a novel face deblurring system based on the dual camera fusion technique for mobile phones. The system detects subject motion to dynamically enable a reference camera, e.g., ultrawide angle camera commonly available on recent premium phones, and captures an auxiliary photo with faster shutter settings. While the main shot is low noise but blurry, the reference shot is sharp but noisy. We learn ML models to align and fuse these two shots and output a clear photo without motion blur. Our algorithm runs efficiently on Google Pixel 6, which takes 463 ms overhead per shot. Our experiments demonstrate the advantage and robustness of our system against alternative single-image, multi-frame, face-specific, and video deblurring algorithms as well as commercial products.

{"text": "Title: Creating High Resolution Images with a Latent Adversarial Generator\nAuthors: David Berthelot, Peyman Milanfar, Ian Goodfellow\nAbstract: Generating realistic images is difficult, and many formulations for this task have been proposed recently. If we restrict the task to that of generating a particular class of images, however, the task becomes more tractable. That is to say, instead of generating an arbitrary image as a sample from the manifold of natural images, we propose to sample images from a particular \"subspace\" of natural images, directed by a low-resolution image from the same subspace. The problem we address, while close to the formulation of the single-image super-resolution problem, is in fact rather different. Single image super-resolution is the task of predicting the image closest to the ground truth from a relatively low resolution image. We propose to produce samples of high resolution images given extremely small inputs with a new method called Latent Adversarial Generator (LAG). In our generative sampling framework, we only use the input (possibly of very low-resolution) to direct what class of samples the network should produce. As such, the output of our algorithm is not a unique image that relates to the input, but rather a possible se} of related images sampled from the manifold of natural images. Our method learns exclusively in the latent space of the adversary using perceptual loss -- it does not have a pixel loss.", "label": 1}

In parallel, primitive-based methods seek to represent objects as semantically consistent part arrangements. However, due to the simplicity of existing primitive representations, these methods fail to accurately reconstruct 3D shapes using a small number of primitives/parts. We address the trade-off between reconstruction quality and number of parts with Neural Parts, a novel 3D primitive representation that defines primitives using an Invertible Neural Network (INN) which implements homeomorphic mappings between a sphere and the target object. The INN allows us to compute the inverse mapping of the homeomorphism, which in turn, enables the efficient computation of both the implicit surface function of a primitive and its mesh, without any additional post-processing. Our model learns to parse 3D objects into semantically consistent part arrangements without any part-level supervision. Evaluations on ShapeNet, D-FAUST and FreiHAND demonstrate that our primitives can capture complex geometries and thus simultaneously achieve geometrically accurate as well as interpretable reconstructions using an order of magnitude fewer primitives than state-of-the-art shape abstraction methods.", "label": 1}

Traditional maximum a posterior (MAP) based methods rely heavily on fixed and handcrafted priors that certainly are insufficient in characterizing clean images and blur kernels, and usually adopt specially designed alternating minimization to avoid trivial solution. In contrast, existing deep motion deblurring networks learn from massive training images the mapping to clean image or blur kernel, but are limited in handling various complex and large size blur kernels. To connect MAP and deep models, we in this paper present two generative networks for respectively modeling the deep priors of clean image and blur kernel, and propose an unconstrained neural optimization solution to blind deconvolution. In particular, we adopt an asymmetric Autoencoder with skip connections for generating latent clean image, and a fully-connected network (FCN) for generating blur kernel. Moreover, the SoftMax nonlinearity is applied to the output layer of FCN to meet the non-negative and equality constraints. The process of neural optimization can be explained as a kind of \"zero-shot\" self-supervised learning of the generative networks, and thus our proposed method is dubbed SelfDeblur. Experimental results show that our SelfDeblur can achieve notable quantitative gains as well as more visually plausible deblurring results in comparison to state-of-the-art blind deconvolution methods on benchmark datasets and real-world blurry images.

Identifying and understanding manipulated media are crucial to mitigate the social concerns on the potential misuse of GMs. We propose to perform reverse engineering of GMs to infer model hyperparameters from the images generated by these models. We define a novel problem, \"model parsing\", as estimating GM network architectures and training loss functions by examining their generated images - a task seemingly impossible for human beings. To tackle this problem, we propose a framework with two components: a Fingerprint Estimation Network (FEN), which estimates a GM fingerprint from a generated image by training with four constraints to encourage the fingerprint to have desired properties, and a Parsing Network (PN), which predicts network architecture and loss functions from the estimated fingerprints. To evaluate our approach, we collect a fake image dataset with 100K images generated by 116 different GMs. Extensive experiments show encouraging results in parsing the hyperparameters of the unseen models.

For each task we learn a residual block operating in the latent space, which is iteratively called until the target domain is reached. A specific training schedule is required to alleviate the exponentiation effect of the iterations. At test time, it offers several advantages: the number of weight parameters is limited and the compositional design allows one to modulate the strength of the transformation with the number of iterations. This is useful, for instance, when the type or amount of noise to suppress is not known in advance.

The effectiveness of these techniques is, however, subject to the availability of a large number (several tens) of input views of the scene, and computationally demanding optimizations. In this paper, we tackle these limitations for the specific problem of few-shot full 3D head reconstruction, by endowing coordinate-based representations with a probabilistic shape prior that enables faster convergence and better generalization when using few input images (down to three). First, we learn a shape model of 3D heads from thousands of incomplete raw scans using implicit representations. At test time, we jointly overfit two coordinate-based neural networks to the scene, one modeling the geometry and another estimating the surface radiance, using implicit differentiable rendering. We devise a two-stage optimization strategy in which the learned prior is used to initialize and constrain the geometry during an initial optimization phase. Then, the prior is unfrozen and fine-tuned to the scene. By doing this, we achieve high-fidelity head reconstructions, including hair and shoulders, and with a high level of detail that consistently outperforms both state-of-the-art 3D Morphable Models methods in the few-shot scenario, and non-parametric methods when large sets of views are available.", "label": 1}

We propose $\\textbf{Go}$al-conditioned $f$-$\\textbf{A}$dvantage $\\textbf{R}$egression (GoFAR), a novel regression-based offline GCRL algorithm derived from a state-occupancy matching perspective; the key intuition is that the goal-reaching task can be formulated as a state-occupancy matching problem between a dynamics-abiding imitator agent and an expert agent that directly teleports to the goal. In contrast to prior approaches, GoFAR does not require any hindsight relabeling and enjoys uninterleaved optimization for its value and policy networks. These distinct features confer GoFAR with much better offline performance and stability as well as statistical performance guarantee that is unattainable for prior methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that GoFAR's training objectives can be re-purposed to learn an agent-independent goal-conditioned planner from purely offline source-domain data, which enables zero-shot transfer to new target domains. Through extensive experiments, we validate GoFAR's effectiveness in various problem settings and tasks, significantly outperforming prior state-of-art. Notably, on a real robotic dexterous manipulation task, while no other method makes meaningful progress, GoFAR acquires complex manipulation behavior that successfully accomplishes diverse goals.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Title: OSTeC: One-Shot Texture Completion\nAuthors: Baris Gecer, Jiankang Deng, Stefanos Zafeiriou\nAbstract: The last few years have witnessed the great success of non-linear generative models in synthesizing high-quality photorealistic face images. Many recent 3D facial texture reconstruction and pose manipulation from a single image approaches still rely on large and clean face datasets to train image-to-image Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Yet the collection of such a large scale high-resolution 3D texture dataset is still very costly and difficult to maintain age/ethnicity balance. Moreover, regression-based approaches suffer from generalization to the in-the-wild conditions and are unable to fine-tune to a target-image. In this work, we propose an unsupervised approach for one-shot 3D facial texture completion that does not require large-scale texture datasets, but rather harnesses the knowledge stored in 2D face generators. The proposed approach rotates an input image in 3D and fill-in the unseen regions by reconstructing the rotated image in a 2D face generator, based on the visible parts. Finally, we stitch the most visible textures at different angles in the UV image-plane. Further, we frontalize the target image by projecting the completed texture into the generator. The qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the completed UV textures and frontalized images are of high quality, resembles the original identity, can be used to train a texture GAN model for 3DMM fitting and improve pose-invariant face recognition.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Title: MODNet: Real-Time Trimap-Free Portrait Matting via Objective Decomposition\nAuthors: Zhanghan Ke, Jiayu Sun, Kaican Li, Qiong Yan, Rynson W. H. Lau\nAbstract: Existing portrait matting methods either require auxiliary inputs that are costly to obtain or involve multiple stages that are computationally expensive, making them less suitable for real-time applications. In this work, we present a light-weight matting objective decomposition network (MODNet) for portrait matting in real-time with a single input image. The key idea behind our efficient design is by optimizing a series of sub-objectives simultaneously via explicit constraints. In addition, MODNet includes two novel techniques for improving model efficiency and robustness. First, an Efficient Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (e-ASPP) module is introduced to fuse multi-scale features for semantic estimation. Second, a self-supervised sub-objectives consistency (SOC) strategy is proposed to adapt MODNet to real-world data to address the domain shift problem common to trimap-free methods. MODNet is easy to be trained in an end-to-end manner. It is much faster than contemporaneous methods and runs at 67 frames per second on a 1080Ti GPU. Experiments show that MODNet outperforms prior trimap-free methods by a large margin on both Adobe Matting Dataset and a carefully designed photographic portrait matting (PPM-100) benchmark proposed by us. Further, MODNet achieves remarkable results on daily photos and videos. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/ZHKKKe/MODNet, and the PPM-100 benchmark is released at https://github.com/ZHKKKe/PPM.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Title: Audeo: Audio Generation for a Silent Performance Video\nAuthors: Kun Su, Xiulong Liu, Eli Shlizerman\nAbstract: We present a novel system that gets as an input video frames of a musician playing the piano and generates the music for that video. Generation of music from visual cues is a challenging problem and it is not clear whether it is an attainable goal at all. Our main aim in this work is to explore the plausibility of such a transformation and to identify cues and components able to carry the association of sounds with visual events. To achieve the transformation we built a full pipeline named `\\textit{Audeo}' containing three components. We first translate the video frames of the keyboard and the musician hand movements into raw mechanical musical symbolic representation Piano-Roll (Roll) for each video frame which represents the keys pressed at each time step. We then adapt the Roll to be amenable for audio synthesis by including temporal correlations. This step turns out to be critical for meaningful audio generation. As a last step, we implement Midi synthesizers to generate realistic music. \\textit{Audeo} converts video to audio smoothly and clearly with only a few setup constraints. We evaluate \\textit{Audeo} on `in the wild' piano performance videos and obtain that their generated music is of reasonable audio quality and can be successfully recognized with high precision by popular music identification software.", "label": 1}

GLASS is a generative model that is trained on video sequences in an unsupervised manner and that can animate an input image at test time. The method learns to segment frames into foreground-background layers and to generate transitions of the foregrounds over time through a global and local action representation. Global actions are explicitly related to 2D shifts, while local actions are instead related to (both geometric and photometric) local deformations. GLASS uses a recurrent neural network to transition between frames and is trained through a reconstruction loss. We also introduce W-Sprites (Walking Sprites), a novel synthetic dataset with a predefined action space. We evaluate our method on both W-Sprites and real datasets, and find that GLASS is able to generate realistic video sequences from a single input image and to successfully learn a more advanced action space than in prior work.", "label": 1}

We make progress towards this milestone by proposing a diffusion model for video generation that shows very promising initial results. Our model is a natural extension of the standard image diffusion architecture, and it enables jointly training from image and video data, which we find to reduce the variance of minibatch gradients and speed up optimization. To generate long and higher resolution videos we introduce a new conditional sampling technique for spatial and temporal video extension that performs better than previously proposed methods.

{"text": "Title: One-shot Face Reenactment\nAuthors: Yunxuan Zhang, Siwei Zhang, Yue He, Cheng Li, Chen Change Loy, Ziwei Liu\nAbstract: To enable realistic shape (e.g. pose and expression) transfer, existing face reenactment methods rely on a set of target faces for learning subject-specific traits. However, in real-world scenario end-users often only have one target face at hand, rendering existing methods inapplicable. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing a novel one-shot face reenactment learning framework. Our key insight is that the one-shot learner should be able to disentangle and compose appearance and shape information for effective modeling. Specifically, the target face appearance and the source face shape are first projected into latent spaces with their corresponding encoders. Then these two latent spaces are associated by learning a shared decoder that aggregates multi-level features to produce the final reenactment results. To further improve the synthesizing quality on mustache and hair regions, we additionally propose FusionNet which combines the strengths of our learned decoder and the traditional warping method. Extensive experiments show that our one-shot face reenactment system achieves superior transfer fidelity as well as identity preserving capability than alternatives. More remarkably, our approach trained with only one target image per subject achieves competitive results to those using a set of target images, demonstrating the practical merit of this work. Code, models and an additional set of reenacted faces have been publicly released at the project page.", "label": 1}

However, studies have shown that existing language models are inadequate in reasoning. To address the issue, we present POET, a novel reasoning pre-training paradigm. Through pre-training language models with programs and their execution results, POET empowers language models to harvest the reasoning knowledge possessed by program executors via a data-driven approach. POET is conceptually simple and can be instantiated by different kinds of program executors. In this paper, we showcase two simple instances POET-Math and POET-Logic, in addition to a complex instance, POET-SQL. Experimental results on six benchmarks demonstrate that POET can significantly boost model performance in natural language reasoning, such as numerical reasoning, logical reasoning, and multi-hop reasoning. POET opens a new gate on reasoning-enhancement pre-training, and we hope our analysis would shed light on the future research of reasoning like program executors.", "label": 1}

However, vast computation complexity and memory occupation hampers the edge of deplorability and the runtime inference in real-life applications, especially for large-scale VSR task. This paper explores the possibility of real-time VSR system and designs an efficient and generic VSR network, termed EGVSR. The proposed EGVSR is based on spatio-temporal adversarial learning for temporal coherence. In order to pursue faster VSR processing ability up to 4K resolution, this paper tries to choose lightweight network structure and efficient upsampling method to reduce the computation required by EGVSR network under the guarantee of high visual quality. Besides, we implement the batch normalization computation fusion, convolutional acceleration algorithm and other neural network acceleration techniques on the actual hardware platform to optimize the inference process of EGVSR network. Finally, our EGVSR achieves the real-time processing capacity of 4K@29.61FPS. Compared with TecoGAN, the most advanced VSR network at present, we achieve 85.04% reduction of computation density and 7.92x performance speedups. In terms of visual quality, the proposed EGVSR tops the list of most metrics (such as LPIPS, tOF, tLP, etc.) on the public test dataset Vid4 and surpasses other state-of-the-art methods in overall performance score.

However, the most commonly used autoregressive models, Transformers, are prohibitively expensive to scale to the number of inputs and layers needed to capture this long-range structure. We develop Perceiver AR, an autoregressive, modality-agnostic architecture which uses cross-attention to map long-range inputs to a small number of latents while also maintaining end-to-end causal masking. Perceiver AR can directly attend to over a hundred thousand tokens, enabling practical long-context density estimation without the need for hand-crafted sparsity patterns or memory mechanisms. When trained on images or music, Perceiver AR generates outputs with clear long-term coherence and structure.

In general, the high diversity of body shapes of anime characters defies the employment of universal body models like SMPL, which are developed from real-world humans. To overcome this difficulty, CoNR uses a compact and easy-to-obtain landmark encoding to avoid creating a unified UV mapping in the pipeline. In addition, the performance of CoNR can be significantly improved when referring to multiple reference images, thanks to feature space cross-view warping in a carefully designed neural network. Moreover, we have collected a character sheet dataset containing over 700,000 hand-drawn and synthesized images of diverse poses to facilitate research in this area.

Freeman, David Salesin, Brian Curless, Ce Liu\nAbstract: Single image 3D photography enables viewers to view a still image from novel viewpoints. Recent approaches combine monocular depth networks with inpainting networks to achieve compelling results. A drawback of these techniques is the use of hard depth layering, making them unable to model intricate appearance details such as thin hair-like structures. We present SLIDE, a modular and unified system for single image 3D photography that uses a simple yet effective soft layering strategy to better preserve appearance details in novel views. In addition, we propose a novel depth-aware training strategy for our inpainting module, better suited for the 3D photography task. The resulting SLIDE approach is modular, enabling the use of other components such as segmentation and matting for improved layering. At the same time, SLIDE uses an efficient layered depth formulation that only requires a single forward pass through the component networks to produce high quality 3D photos. Extensive experimental analysis on three view-synthesis datasets, in combination with user studies on in-the-wild image collections, demonstrate superior performance of our technique in comparison to existing strong baselines while being conceptually much simpler.

We find that current large language models are significantly undertrained, a consequence of the recent focus on scaling language models whilst keeping the amount of training data constant. By training over \\nummodels language models ranging from 70 million to over 16 billion parameters on 5 to 500 billion tokens, we find that for compute-optimal training, the model size and the number of training tokens should be scaled equally: for every doubling of model size the number of training tokens should also be doubled. We test this hypothesis by training a predicted compute-optimal model, \\chinchilla, that uses the same compute budget as \\gopher but with 70B parameters and 4$\\times$ more more data. \\chinchilla uniformly and significantly outperforms \\Gopher (280B), GPT-3 (175B), Jurassic-1 (178B), and Megatron-Turing NLG (530B) on a large range of downstream evaluation tasks. This also means that \\chinchilla uses substantially less compute for fine-tuning and inference, greatly facilitating downstream usage.

Cen, Zhe Wang, Audrunas Gruslys, Aleksandra Ma\nAbstract: We introduce DeepNash, an autonomous agent capable of learning to play the imperfect information game Stratego from scratch, up to a human expert level. Stratego is one of the few iconic board games that Artificial Intelligence (AI) has not yet mastered. This popular game has an enormous game tree on the order of $10^{535}$ nodes, i.e., $10^{175}$ times larger than that of Go. It has the additional complexity of requiring decision-making under imperfect information, similar to Texas hold'em poker, which has a significantly smaller game tree (on the order of $10^{164}$ nodes). Decisions in Stratego are made over a large number of discrete actions with no obvious link between action and outcome. Episodes are long, with often hundreds of moves before a player wins, and situations in Stratego can not easily be broken down into manageably-sized sub-problems as in poker. For these reasons, Stratego has been a grand challenge for the field of AI for decades, and existing AI methods barely reach an amateur level of play. DeepNash uses a game-theoretic, model-free deep reinforcement learning method, without search, that learns to master Stratego via self-play. The Regularised Nash Dynamics (R-NaD) algorithm, a key component of DeepNash, converges to an approximate Nash equilibrium, instead of 'cycling' around it, by directly modifying the underlying multi-agent learning dynamics. DeepNash beats existing state-of-the-art AI methods in Stratego and achieved a yearly (2022) and all-time top-3 rank on the Gravon games platform, competing with human expert players.", "label": 1}

Torr, Luca Bertinetto\nAbstract: Tracking objects of interest in a video is one of the most popular and widely applicable problems in computer vision. However, with the years, a Cambrian explosion of use cases and benchmarks has fragmented the problem in a multitude of different experimental setups. As a consequence, the literature has fragmented too, and now novel approaches proposed by the community are usually specialised to fit only one specific setup. To understand to what extent this specialisation is necessary, in this work we present UniTrack, a solution to address five different tasks within the same framework. UniTrack consists of a single and task-agnostic appearance model, which can be learned in a supervised or self-supervised fashion, and multiple ``heads'' that address individual tasks and do not require training. We show how most tracking tasks can be solved within this framework, and that the same appearance model can be successfully used to obtain results that are competitive against specialised methods for most of the tasks considered. The framework also allows us to analyse appearance models obtained with the most recent self-supervised methods, thus extending their evaluation and comparison to a larger variety of important problems.", "label": 1}

We hope to deliver a key message that current visual recognition systems are far from complete, i.e., recognizing everything that human can recognize, yet it is very unlikely that the gap can be bridged by continuously increasing human annotations. Based on the observation, we advocate for a new type of pre-training task named learning-by-compression. The computational models (e.g., a deep network) are optimized to represent the visual data using compact features, and the features preserve the ability to recover the original data. Semantic annotations, when available, play the role of weak supervision. An important yet challenging issue is the evaluation of image recovery, where we suggest some design principles and future research directions.

In this paper, we propose the Hessian Penalty, a simple regularization term that encourages the Hessian of a generative model with respect to its input to be diagonal. We introduce a model-agnostic, unbiased stochastic approximation of this term based on Hutchinson's estimator to compute it efficiently during training. Our method can be applied to a wide range of deep generators with just a few lines of code. We show that training with the Hessian Penalty often causes axis-aligned disentanglement to emerge in latent space when applied to ProGAN on several datasets. Additionally, we use our regularization term to identify interpretable directions in BigGAN's latent space in an unsupervised fashion. Finally, we provide empirical evidence that the Hessian Penalty encourages substantial shrinkage when applied to over-parameterized latent spaces.", "label": 1}

During the epidemic prevention and control period, our study can be helpful in prognosis, diagnosis and screening for the patients infected with COVID-19 (the novel coronavirus) based on breathing characteristics. According to the latest clinical research, the respiratory pattern of COVID-19 is different from the respiratory patterns of flu and the common cold. One significant symptom that occurs in the COVID-19 is Tachypnea. People infected with COVID-19 have more rapid respiration. Our study can be utilized to distinguish various respiratory patterns and our device can be preliminarily put to practical use. Demo videos of this method working in situations of one subject and two subjects can be downloaded online. Research details: Accurate detection of the unexpected abnormal respiratory pattern of people in a remote and unobtrusive manner has great significance. In this work, we innovatively capitalize on depth camera and deep learning to achieve this goal. The challenges in this task are twofold: the amount of real-world data is not enough for training to get the deep model; and the intra-class variation of different types of respiratory patterns is large and the outer-class variation is small. In this paper, considering the characteristics of actual respiratory signals, a novel and efficient Respiratory Simulation Model (RSM) is first proposed to fill the gap between the large amount of training data and scarce real-world data. The proposed deep model and the modeling ideas have the great potential to be extended to large scale applications such as public places, sleep scenario, and office environment.", "label": 1}

While many approaches rely on expensive 3D sensors such as LiDAR to produce accurate 3D estimates, methods that exploit stereo cameras have recently shown promising results at a lower cost. Existing approaches tackle this problem in two steps: first depth estimation from stereo images is performed to produce a pseudo LiDAR point cloud, which is then used as input to a 3D object detector. However, this approach is suboptimal due to the representation mismatch, as the two tasks are optimized in two different metric spaces. In this paper we propose a model that unifies these two tasks and performs them in the same metric space. Specifically, we directly construct a pseudo LiDAR feature volume (PLUME) in 3D space, which is then used to solve both depth estimation and object detection tasks. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with much faster inference times when compared to existing methods on the challenging KITTI benchmark.", "label": 1}

Our algorithm uses a CNN architecture that leverages the inherent correlation between facial expression and hand gestures. Synthesis of conversational body gestures is a multi-modal problem since many similar gestures can plausibly accompany the same input speech. To synthesize plausible body gestures in this setting, we train a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based model that measures the plausibility of the generated sequences of 3D body motion when paired with the input audio features. We also contribute a new way to create a large corpus of more than 33 hours of annotated body, hand, and face data from in-the-wild videos of talking people. To this end, we apply state-of-the-art monocular approaches for 3D body and hand pose estimation as well as dense 3D face performance capture to the video corpus. In this way, we can train on orders of magnitude more data than previous algorithms that resort to complex in-studio motion capture solutions, and thereby train more expressive synthesis algorithms.

We propose in this paper a region-wise normalization framework, for region level face translation. While per-region style is encoded using available approach, we build a so called RIN (region-wise normalization) block to individually inject the styles into per-region feature maps and then fuse them for following convolution and upsampling. Both shape and texture of different regions can thus be translated to various target styles. A region matching loss has also been proposed to significantly reduce the inference between regions during the translation process. Extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets, i.e. Morph, RaFD and CelebAMask-HQ, suggest that our approach demonstrate a large improvement over state-of-the-art methods like StarGAN, SEAN and FUNIT.

We assume that low resolution (LR) images are relatively easy to collect compared to high resolution (HR) images. By allowing multiple LR images, we build a set of pseudo pairs by denoising and downsampling LR images and cast the original unsupervised problem into a supervised learning problem but in one level lower. Though this line of study is easy to think of and thus should have been investigated prior to any complicated unsupervised methods, surprisingly, there are currently none. Even more, we show that this simple method outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised method with a dramatically shorter latency at runtime, and significantly reduces the gap to the HR supervised models. We submitted our method in NTIRE 2020 super-resolution challenge and won 1st in PSNR, 2nd in SSIM, and 13th in LPIPS. This simple method should be used as the baseline to beat in the future, especially when multiple LR images are allowed during the training phase.

Nonetheless, mesh generation and synthesis remains a fundamental topic in computer graphics. In this work, we propose a novel framework for synthesizing geometric textures. It learns geometric texture statistics from local neighborhoods (i.e., local triangular patches) of a single reference 3D model. It learns deep features on the faces of the input triangulation, which is used to subdivide and generate offsets across multiple scales, without parameterization of the reference or target mesh. Our network displaces mesh vertices in any direction (i.e., in the normal and tangential direction), enabling synthesis of geometric textures, which cannot be expressed by a simple 2D displacement map. Learning and synthesizing on local geometric patches enables a genus-oblivious framework, facilitating texture transfer between shapes of different genus.", "label": 1}

The proposed SelectionGAN explicitly utilizes the semantic guidance information and consists of two stages. In the first stage, the input image and the conditional semantic guidance are fed into a cycled semantic-guided generation network to produce initial coarse results. In the second stage, we refine the initial results by using the proposed multi-scale spatial pooling & channel selection module and the multi-channel attention selection module. Moreover, uncertainty maps automatically learned from attention maps are used to guide the pixel loss for better network optimization. Exhaustive experiments on four challenging guided image-to-image translation tasks (face, hand, body, and street view) demonstrate that our SelectionGAN is able to generate significantly better results than the state-of-the-art methods. Meanwhile, the proposed framework and modules are unified solutions and can be applied to solve other generation tasks such as semantic image synthesis.

{"text": "Title: Unifying Diffusion Models' Latent Space, with Applications to CycleDiffusion and Guidance\nAuthors: Chen Henry Wu, Fernando De la Torre\nAbstract: Diffusion models have achieved unprecedented performance in generative modeling. The commonly-adopted formulation of the latent code of diffusion models is a sequence of gradually denoised samples, as opposed to the simpler (e.g., Gaussian) latent space of GANs, VAEs, and normalizing flows. This paper provides an alternative, Gaussian formulation of the latent space of various diffusion models, as well as an invertible DPM-Encoder that maps images into the latent space. While our formulation is purely based on the definition of diffusion models, we demonstrate several intriguing consequences. (1) Empirically, we observe that a common latent space emerges from two diffusion models trained independently on related domains. In light of this finding, we propose CycleDiffusion, which uses DPM-Encoder for unpaired image-to-image translation. Furthermore, applying CycleDiffusion to text-to-image diffusion models, we show that large-scale text-to-image diffusion models can be used as zero-shot image-to-image editors. (2) One can guide pre-trained diffusion models and GANs by controlling the latent codes in a unified, plug-and-play formulation based on energy-based models. Using the CLIP model and a face recognition model as guidance, we demonstrate that diffusion models have better coverage of low-density sub-populations and individuals than GANs.", "label": 1}

Towards addressing this, we present BugLab, an approach for self-supervised learning of bug detection and repair. BugLab co-trains two models: (1) a detector model that learns to detect and repair bugs in code, (2) a selector model that learns to create buggy code for the detector to use as training data. A Python implementation of BugLab improves by up to 30% upon baseline methods on a test dataset of 2374 real-life bugs and finds 19 previously unknown bugs in open-source software.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Title: Unsupervised Layered Image Decomposition into Object Prototypes\nAuthors: Tom Monnier, Elliot Vincent, Jean Ponce, Mathieu Aubry\nAbstract: We present an unsupervised learning framework for decomposing images into layers of automatically discovered object models. Contrary to recent approaches that model image layers with autoencoder networks, we represent them as explicit transformations of a small set of prototypical images. Our model has three main components: (i) a set of object prototypes in the form of learnable images with a transparency channel, which we refer to as sprites; (ii) differentiable parametric functions predicting occlusions and transformation parameters necessary to instantiate the sprites in a given image; (iii) a layered image formation model with occlusion for compositing these instances into complete images including background. By jointly learning the sprites and occlusion/transformation predictors to reconstruct images, our approach not only yields accurate layered image decompositions, but also identifies object categories and instance parameters. We first validate our approach by providing results on par with the state of the art on standard multi-object synthetic benchmarks (Tetrominoes, Multi-dSprites, CLEVR6). We then demonstrate the applicability of our model to real images in tasks that include clustering (SVHN, GTSRB), cosegmentation (Weizmann Horse) and object discovery from unfiltered social network images. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first layered image decomposition algorithm that learns an explicit and shared concept of object type, and is robust enough to be applied to real images.", "label": 1}

Recent two-stage methods first generate class-agnostic mask proposals and then leverage pre-trained vision-language models, e.g., CLIP, to classify masked regions. We identify the performance bottleneck of this paradigm to be the pre-trained CLIP model, since it does not perform well on masked images. To address this, we propose to finetune CLIP on a collection of masked image regions and their corresponding text descriptions. We collect training data by mining an existing image-caption dataset (e.g., COCO Captions), using CLIP to match masked image regions to nouns in the image captions. Compared with the more precise and manually annotated segmentation labels with fixed classes (e.g., COCO-Stuff), we find our noisy but diverse dataset can better retain CLIP's generalization ability. Along with finetuning the entire model, we utilize the \"blank\" areas in masked images using a method we dub mask prompt tuning. Experiments demonstrate mask prompt tuning brings significant improvement without modifying any weights of CLIP, and it can further improve a fully finetuned model. In particular, when trained on COCO and evaluated on ADE20K-150, our best model achieves 29.6% mIoU, which is +8.5% higher than the previous state-of-the-art. For the first time, open-vocabulary generalist models match the performance of supervised specialist models in 2017 without dataset-specific adaptations.", "label": 1}

Our method, termed Deep Point Correspondence (DPC), requires a fraction of the training data compared to previous techniques and presents better generalization capabilities. Until now, two main approaches have been suggested for the dense correspondence problem. The first is a spectral-based approach that obtains great results on synthetic datasets but requires mesh connectivity of the shapes and long inference processing time while being unstable in real-world scenarios. The second is a spatial approach that uses an encoder-decoder framework to regress an ordered point cloud for the matching alignment from an irregular input. Unfortunately, the decoder brings considerable disadvantages, as it requires a large amount of training data and struggles to generalize well in cross-dataset evaluations. DPC's novelty lies in its lack of a decoder component. Instead, we use latent similarity and the input coordinates themselves to construct the point cloud and determine correspondence, replacing the coordinate regression done by the decoder. Extensive experiments show that our construction scheme leads to a performance boost in comparison to recent state-of-the-art correspondence methods.

Previous methods based on conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) have shown their power to generate visually plausible images when a conditional image and an output image share well-aligned structures. However, these models fail to synthesize face images with a whole set of well-defined structures, e.g. eyes, noses, mouths, etc., especially when the conditional line map lacks one or several parts. To address this problem, we propose a conditional self-attention generative adversarial network (CSAGAN). We introduce a conditional self-attention mechanism to cGANs to capture long-range dependencies between different regions in faces. We also build a multi-scale discriminator. The large-scale discriminator enforces the completeness of global structures and the small-scale discriminator encourages fine details, thereby enhancing the realism of generated face images. We evaluate the proposed model on the CelebA-HD dataset by two perceptual user studies and three quantitative metrics. The experiment results demonstrate that our method generates high-quality facial images while preserving facial structures. Our results outperform state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.", "label": 1}

However, autoregressive voice cloning systems still suffer from text alignment failures, resulting in an inability to synthesize long sentences. In this work, we propose a variant of attention-based text-to-speech system that can reproduce a target voice from a few seconds of reference speech and generalize to very long utterances as well. The proposed system is based on three independently trained components: a speaker encoder, synthesizer and universal vocoder. Generalization to long utterances is realized using an energy-based attention mechanism known as Dynamic Convolution Attention, in combination with a set of modifications proposed for the synthesizer based on Tacotron 2. Moreover, effective zero-shot speaker adaptation is achieved by conditioning both the synthesizer and vocoder on a speaker encoder that has been pretrained on a large corpus of diverse data. We compare several implementations of voice cloning systems in terms of speech naturalness, speaker similarity, alignment consistency and ability to synthesize long utterances, and conclude that the proposed model can produce intelligible synthetic speech for extremely long utterances, while preserving a high extent of naturalness and similarity for short texts.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Title: Volumetric Disentanglement for 3D Scene Manipulation\nAuthors: Sagie Benaim, Frederik Warburg, Peter Ebert Christensen, Serge Belongie\nAbstract: Recently, advances in differential volumetric rendering enabled significant breakthroughs in the photo-realistic and fine-detailed reconstruction of complex 3D scenes, which is key for many virtual reality applications. However, in the context of augmented reality, one may also wish to effect semantic manipulations or augmentations of objects within a scene. To this end, we propose a volumetric framework for (i) disentangling or separating, the volumetric representation of a given foreground object from the background, and (ii) semantically manipulating the foreground object, as well as the background. Our framework takes as input a set of 2D masks specifying the desired foreground object for training views, together with the associated 2D views and poses, and produces a foreground-background disentanglement that respects the surrounding illumination, reflections, and partial occlusions, which can be applied to both training and novel views. Our method enables the separate control of pixel color and depth as well as 3D similarity transformations of both the foreground and background objects. We subsequently demonstrate the applicability of our framework on a number of downstream manipulation tasks including object camouflage, non-negative 3D object inpainting, 3D object translation, 3D object inpainting, and 3D text-based object manipulation.

{"text": "Title: One Pass ImageNet\nAuthors: Huiyi Hu, Ang Li, Daniele Calandriello, Dilan Gorur\nAbstract: We present the One Pass ImageNet (OPIN) problem, which aims to study the effectiveness of deep learning in a streaming setting. ImageNet is a widely known benchmark dataset that has helped drive and evaluate recent advancements in deep learning. Typically, deep learning methods are trained on static data that the models have random access to, using multiple passes over the dataset with a random shuffle at each epoch of training. Such data access assumption does not hold in many real-world scenarios where massive data is collected from a stream and storing and accessing all the data becomes impractical due to storage costs and privacy concerns. For OPIN, we treat the ImageNet data as arriving sequentially, and there is limited memory budget to store a small subset of the data. We observe that training a deep network in a single pass with the same training settings used for multi-epoch training results in a huge drop in prediction accuracy. We show that the performance gap can be significantly decreased by paying a small memory cost and utilizing techniques developed for continual learning, despite the fact that OPIN differs from typical continual problem settings. We propose using OPIN to study resource-efficient deep learning.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Title: Transformer Meets Tracker: Exploiting Temporal Context for Robust Visual Tracking\nAuthors: Ning Wang, Wengang Zhou, Jie Wang, Houqaing Li\nAbstract: In video object tracking, there exist rich temporal contexts among successive frames, which have been largely overlooked in existing trackers. In this work, we bridge the individual video frames and explore the temporal contexts across them via a transformer architecture for robust object tracking. Different from classic usage of the transformer in natural language processing tasks, we separate its encoder and decoder into two parallel branches and carefully design them within the Siamese-like tracking pipelines. The transformer encoder promotes the target templates via attention-based feature reinforcement, which benefits the high-quality tracking model generation. The transformer decoder propagates the tracking cues from previous templates to the current frame, which facilitates the object searching process. Our transformer-assisted tracking framework is neat and trained in an end-to-end manner. With the proposed transformer, a simple Siamese matching approach is able to outperform the current top-performing trackers. By combining our transformer with the recent discriminative tracking pipeline, our method sets several new state-of-the-art records on prevalent tracking benchmarks.", "label": 1}

GEOMANCER provides a partial answer to the question posed by Higgins et al. (2018): is it possible to learn how to factorize a Lie group solely from observations of the orbit of an object it acts on? We show that fully unsupervised factorization of a data manifold is possible if the true metric of the manifold is known and each factor manifold has nontrivial holonomy -- for example, rotation in 3D. Our algorithm works by estimating the subspaces that are invariant under random walk diffusion, giving an approximation to the de Rham decomposition from differential geometry. We demonstrate the efficacy of GEOMANCER on several complex synthetic manifolds. Our work reduces the question of whether unsupervised disentangling is possible to the question of whether unsupervised metric learning is possible, providing a unifying insight into the geometric nature of representation learning.", "label": 1}

In this work, we propose a new approach that brings the best of both worlds together. Our system consists of three major components: (1) a 3D-semantics-aware generative model that produces view-consistent, disentangled face images and semantic masks; (2) a hybrid GAN inversion approach that initialize the latent codes from the semantic and texture encoder, and further optimized them for faithful reconstruction; and (3) a canonical editor that enables efficient manipulation of semantic masks in canonical view and product high-quality editing results.

In this work, we propose robust one-shot SVC (ROSVC) that performs any-to-any SVC robustly even on such distorted singing voices using less than 10s of a reference voice. To this end, we propose two-stage training method called Robustify. In the first stage, a novel one-shot SVC model based on a generative adversarial network is trained on clean data to ensure high-quality conversion. In the second stage, enhancement modules are introduced to the encoders of the model to improve the robustness against distortions in the feature space. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms one-shot SVC baselines for both seen and unseen singers and greatly improves the robustness against the distortions.", "label": 1}

In contrast to previous approaches that attempt to learn direct mappings from audio to raw pixels or points for creating talking faces, our method first disentangles the content and speaker information in the input audio signal. The audio content robustly controls the motion of lips and nearby facial regions, while the speaker information determines the specifics of facial expressions and the rest of the talking head dynamics. Another key component of our method is the prediction of facial landmarks reflecting speaker-aware dynamics. Based on this intermediate representation, our method is able to synthesize photorealistic videos of entire talking heads with full range of motion and also animate artistic paintings, sketches, 2D cartoon characters, Japanese mangas, stylized caricatures in a single unified framework. We present extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation of our method, in addition to user studies, demonstrating generated talking heads of significantly higher quality compared to prior state-of-the-art.", "label": 1}

In this work, we seek to substantially reduce the inputs to a single unposed image. Existing approaches condition on local image features to reconstruct a 3D object, but often render blurry predictions at viewpoints that are far away from the source view. To address this issue, we propose to leverage both the global and local features to form an expressive 3D representation. The global features are learned from a vision transformer, while the local features are extracted from a 2D convolutional network. To synthesize a novel view, we train a multilayer perceptron (MLP) network conditioned on the learned 3D representation to perform volume rendering. This novel 3D representation allows the network to reconstruct unseen regions without enforcing constraints like symmetry or canonical coordinate systems. Our method can render novel views from only a single input image and generalize across multiple object categories using a single model. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance and renders richer details than existing approaches.", "label": 1}

Specifically, we extend recent deep-learning-based, data-driven methods for speech-driven gesture generation by incorporating representation learning. Our model takes speech as input and produces gestures as output, in the form of a sequence of 3D coordinates. We provide an analysis of different representations for the input (speech) and the output (motion) of the network by both objective and subjective evaluations. We also analyse the importance of smoothing of the produced motion. Our results indicated that the proposed method improved on our baseline in terms of objective measures. For example, it better captured the motion dynamics and better matched the motion-speed distribution. Moreover, we performed user studies on two different datasets. The studies confirmed that our proposed method is perceived as more natural than the baseline, although the difference in the studies was eliminated by appropriate post-processing: hip-centering and smoothing. We conclude that it is important to take both motion representation and post-processing into account when designing an automatic gesture-production method.", "label": 1}

In contrast to most existing annotation datasets in computer vision, we focus on the affective experience triggered by visual artworks and ask the annotators to indicate the dominant emotion they feel for a given image and, crucially, to also provide a grounded verbal explanation for their emotion choice. As we demonstrate below, this leads to a rich set of signals for both the objective content and the affective impact of an image, creating associations with abstract concepts (e.g., \"freedom\" or \"love\"), or references that go beyond what is directly visible, including visual similes and metaphors, or subjective references to personal experiences. We focus on visual art (e.g., paintings, artistic photographs) as it is a prime example of imagery created to elicit emotional responses from its viewers. Our dataset, termed ArtEmis, contains 439K emotion attributions and explanations from humans, on 81K artworks from WikiArt. Building on this data, we train and demonstrate a series of captioning systems capable of expressing and explaining emotions from visual stimuli. Remarkably, the captions produced by these systems often succeed in reflecting the semantic and abstract content of the image, going well beyond systems trained on existing datasets.

Despite their successful performance, CNNs suffer from a major drawback. They fail to capture the hierarchy of spatial relation among different parts of an entity. As a remedy to this problem, the idea of capsules was proposed by Hinton. In this paper, we propose the SubSpace Capsule Network (SCN) that exploits the idea of capsule networks to model possible variations in the appearance or implicitly defined properties of an entity through a group of capsule subspaces instead of simply grouping neurons to create capsules. A capsule is created by projecting an input feature vector from a lower layer onto the capsule subspace using a learnable transformation. This transformation finds the degree of alignment of the input with the properties modeled by the capsule subspace. We show that SCN is a general capsule network that can successfully be applied to both discriminative and generative models without incurring computational overhead compared to CNN during test time. Effectiveness of SCN is evaluated through a comprehensive set of experiments on supervised image classification, semi-supervised image classification and high-resolution image generation tasks using the generative adversarial network (GAN) framework.

To achieve this, we first lift people to 3D from a single frame in a robust way. This lifting includes information about the 3D pose of the person, his or her location in the 3D space, and the 3D appearance. As we track a person, we collect 3D observations over time in a tracklet representation. Given the 3D nature of our observations, we build temporal models for each one of the previous attributes. We use these models to predict the future state of the tracklet, including 3D location, 3D appearance, and 3D pose. For a future frame, we compute the similarity between the predicted state of a tracklet and the single frame observations in a probabilistic manner. Association is solved with simple Hungarian matching, and the matches are used to update the respective tracklets.

First, we learn to encode articulated human motions on a dense UV manifold of the human body surface. To handle complicated motions (e.g., self-occlusions), we then leverage the encoded information on the UV manifold to construct a 3D volumetric representation based on a dynamic pose-conditioned neural radiance field. While this allows us to represent 3D geometry with changing topology, volumetric rendering is computationally heavy. Hence we employ only a rough volumetric representation using a pose-conditioned downsampled neural radiance field (PD-NeRF), which we can render efficiently at low resolutions. In addition, we learn 2D textural features that are fused with rendered volumetric features in image space. The key advantage of our approach is that we can then convert the fused features into a high-resolution, high-quality avatar by a fast GAN-based textural renderer. We demonstrate that hybrid rendering enables HVTR to handle complicated motions, render high-quality avatars under user-controlled poses/shapes and even loose clothing, and most importantly, be efficient at inference time.

Existing deep architectures are either manually designed or automatically searched by some Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods. However, even a well-designed/searched architecture may still contain many nonsignificant or redundant modules/operations. Thus, it is necessary to optimize the operations inside an architecture to improve the performance without introducing extra computational cost. To this end, we have proposed a Neural Architecture Transformer (NAT) method which casts the optimization problem into a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and seeks to replace the redundant operations with more efficient operations, such as skip or null connection. Note that NAT only considers a small number of possible transitions and thus comes with a limited search/transition space. As a result, such a small search space may hamper the performance of architecture optimization. To address this issue, we propose a Neural Architecture Transformer++ (NAT++) method which further enlarges the set of candidate transitions to improve the performance of architecture optimization. Specifically, we present a two-level transition rule to obtain valid transitions, i.e., allowing operations to have more efficient types (e.g., convolution->separable convolution) or smaller kernel sizes (e.g., 5x5->3x3). Note that different operations may have different valid transitions. We further propose a Binary-Masked Softmax (BMSoftmax) layer to omit the possible invalid transitions. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show that the transformed architecture significantly outperforms both its original counterpart and the architectures optimized by existing methods.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Title: LARGE: Latent-Based Regression through GAN Semantics\nAuthors: Yotam Nitzan, Rinon Gal, Ofir Brenner, Daniel Cohen-Or\nAbstract: We propose a novel method for solving regression tasks using few-shot or weak supervision. At the core of our method is the fundamental observation that GANs are incredibly successful at encoding semantic information within their latent space, even in a completely unsupervised setting. For modern generative frameworks, this semantic encoding manifests as smooth, linear directions which affect image attributes in a disentangled manner. These directions have been widely used in GAN-based image editing. We show that such directions are not only linear, but that the magnitude of change induced on the respective attribute is approximately linear with respect to the distance traveled along them. By leveraging this observation, our method turns a pre-trained GAN into a regression model, using as few as two labeled samples. This enables solving regression tasks on datasets and attributes which are difficult to produce quality supervision for. Additionally, we show that the same latent-distances can be used to sort collections of images by the strength of given attributes, even in the absence of explicit supervision. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method can be applied across a wide range of domains, leverage multiple latent direction discovery frameworks, and achieve state-of-the-art results in few-shot and low-supervision settings, even when compared to methods designed to tackle a single task.", "label": 1}

Cost aggregation is a highly important process in matching tasks, which the matching accuracy depends on the quality of its output. Compared to hand-crafted or CNN-based methods addressing the cost aggregation, in that either lacks robustness to severe deformations or inherit the limitation of CNNs that fail to discriminate incorrect matches due to limited receptive fields, CATs explore global consensus among initial correlation map with the help of some architectural designs that allow us to fully leverage self-attention mechanism. Specifically, we include appearance affinity modeling to aid the cost aggregation process in order to disambiguate the noisy initial correlation maps and propose multi-level aggregation to efficiently capture different semantics from hierarchical feature representations. We then combine with swapping self-attention technique and residual connections not only to enforce consistent matching but also to ease the learning process, which we find that these result in an apparent performance boost. We conduct experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model over the latest methods and provide extensive ablation studies.

Le\nAbstract: This paper introduces EfficientNetV2, a new family of convolutional networks that have faster training speed and better parameter efficiency than previous models. To develop this family of models, we use a combination of training-aware neural architecture search and scaling, to jointly optimize training speed and parameter efficiency. The models were searched from the search space enriched with new ops such as Fused-MBConv. Our experiments show that EfficientNetV2 models train much faster than state-of-the-art models while being up to 6.8x smaller.   Our training can be further sped up by progressively increasing the image size during training, but it often causes a drop in accuracy. To compensate for this accuracy drop, we propose to adaptively adjust regularization (e.g., dropout and data augmentation) as well, such that we can achieve both fast training and good accuracy.   With progressive learning, our EfficientNetV2 significantly outperforms previous models on ImageNet and CIFAR/Cars/Flowers datasets.

Soccer goalkeeping using quadrupeds is a challenging problem, that combines highly dynamic locomotion with precise and fast non-prehensile object (ball) manipulation. The robot needs to react to and intercept a potentially flying ball using dynamic locomotion maneuvers in a very short amount of time, usually less than one second. In this paper, we propose to address this problem using a hierarchical model-free RL framework. The first component of the framework contains multiple control policies for distinct locomotion skills, which can be used to cover different regions of the goal. Each control policy enables the robot to track random parametric end-effector trajectories while performing one specific locomotion skill, such as jump, dive, and sidestep. These skills are then utilized by the second part of the framework which is a high-level planner to determine a desired skill and end-effector trajectory in order to intercept a ball flying to different regions of the goal. We deploy the proposed framework on a Mini Cheetah quadrupedal robot and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for various agile interceptions of a fast-moving ball in the real world.", "label": 1}

Ngai\nAbstract: Considering the microphone is easily affected by noise and soundproof materials, the radio frequency (RF) signal is a promising candidate to recover audio as it is immune to noise and can traverse many soundproof objects. In this paper, we introduce Radio2Speech, a system that uses RF signals to recover high quality speech from the loudspeaker. Radio2Speech can recover speech comparable to the quality of the microphone, advancing from recovering only single tone music or incomprehensible speech in existing approaches. We use Radio UNet to accurately recover speech in time-frequency domain from RF signals with limited frequency band. Also, we incorporate the neural vocoder to synthesize the speech waveform from the estimated time-frequency representation without using the contaminated phase. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that in quiet, noisy and soundproof scenarios, Radio2Speech achieves state-of-the-art performance and is on par with the microphone that works in quiet scenarios.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Title: Active Learning for Deep Object Detection via Probabilistic Modeling\nAuthors: Jiwoong Choi, Ismail Elezi, Hyuk-Jae Lee, Clement Farabet, Jose M. Alvarez\nAbstract: Active learning aims to reduce labeling costs by selecting only the most informative samples on a dataset. Few existing works have addressed active learning for object detection. Most of these methods are based on multiple models or are straightforward extensions of classification methods, hence estimate an image's informativeness using only the classification head. In this paper, we propose a novel deep active learning approach for object detection. Our approach relies on mixture density networks that estimate a probabilistic distribution for each localization and classification head's output. We explicitly estimate the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in a single forward pass of a single model. Our method uses a scoring function that aggregates these two types of uncertainties for both heads to obtain every image's informativeness score. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in PASCAL VOC and MS-COCO datasets. Our approach outperforms single-model based methods and performs on par with multi-model based methods at a fraction of the computing cost.", "label": 1}

Our technique employs expression analysis for proxy face geometry generation and combines supervised and unsupervised learning for facial detail synthesis. On proxy generation, we conduct emotion prediction to determine a new expression-informed proxy.

CodeBERT learns general-purpose representations that support downstream NL-PL applications such as natural language codesearch, code documentation generation, etc. We develop CodeBERT with Transformer-based neural architecture, and train it with a hybrid objective function that incorporates the pre-training task of replaced token detection, which is to detect plausible alternatives sampled from generators. This enables us to utilize both bimodal data of NL-PL pairs and unimodal data, where the former provides input tokens for model training while the latter helps to learn better generators. We evaluate CodeBERT on two NL-PL applications by fine-tuning model parameters. Results show that CodeBERT achieves state-of-the-art performance on both natural language code search and code documentation generation tasks. Furthermore, to investigate what type of knowledge is learned in CodeBERT, we construct a dataset for NL-PL probing, and evaluate in a zero-shot setting where parameters of pre-trained models are fixed.

However, for tasks that require a large amount of knowledge, non-parametric memory allows models to grow dramatically with a sub-linear increase in computational cost and GPU memory requirements. Recent models such as RAG and REALM have introduced retrieval into conditional generation. These models incorporate neural initial retrieval from a corpus of passages. We build on this line of research, proposing Re2G, which combines both neural initial retrieval and reranking into a BART-based sequence-to-sequence generation. Our reranking approach also permits merging retrieval results from sources with incomparable scores, enabling an ensemble of BM25 and neural initial retrieval. To train our system end-to-end, we introduce a novel variation of knowledge distillation to train the initial retrieval, reranker, and generation using only ground truth on the target sequence output. We find large gains in four diverse tasks: zero-shot slot filling, question answering, fact-checking, and dialog, with relative gains of 9% to 34% over the previous state-of-the-art on the KILT leaderboard.

Perhaps due to this diversity, previous work has typically relied on domain-specific recipes with limited sharing of the underlying data, model architectures, and objectives. We present Pix2Struct, a pretrained image-to-text model for purely visual language understanding, which can be finetuned on tasks containing visually-situated language. Pix2Struct is pretrained by learning to parse masked screenshots of web pages into simplified HTML. The web, with its richness of visual elements cleanly reflected in the HTML structure, provides a large source of pretraining data well suited to the diversity of downstream tasks. Intuitively, this objective subsumes common pretraining signals such as OCR, language modeling, image captioning. In addition to the novel pretraining strategy, we introduce a variable-resolution input representation and a more flexible integration of language and vision inputs, where language prompts such as questions are rendered directly on top of the input image. For the first time, we show that a single pretrained model can achieve state-of-the-art results in six out of nine tasks across four domains: documents, illustrations, user interfaces, and natural images.", "label": 1}

This enables various object-centric rendering applications such as novel-view synthesis, relighting, and harmonized background composition from challenging in-the-wild input. Using a multi-stage approach extending neural radiance fields, we first infer the surface geometry and refine the coarsely estimated initial camera parameters, while leveraging coarse foreground object masks to improve the training efficiency and geometry quality. We also introduce a robust normal estimation technique which eliminates the effect of geometric noise while retaining crucial details. Lastly, we extract surface material properties and ambient illumination, represented in spherical harmonics with extensions that handle transient elements, e.g. sharp shadows.

In this paper, we propose a new approach, named as EFL, that can turn small LMs into better few-shot learners. The key idea of this approach is to reformulate potential NLP task into an entailment one, and then fine-tune the model with as little as 8 examples. We further demonstrate our proposed method can be: (i) naturally combined with an unsupervised contrastive learning-based data augmentation method; (ii) easily extended to multilingual few-shot learning. A systematic evaluation on 18 standard NLP tasks demonstrates that this approach improves the various existing SOTA few-shot learning methods by 12\\%, and yields competitive few-shot performance with 500 times larger models, such as GPT-3.", "label": 1}

This is a challenging problem that goes far beyond the capabilities of current view synthesis methods, which quickly degenerate when presented with large camera motions. Methods for video generation also have limited ability to produce long sequences and are often agnostic to scene geometry. We take a hybrid approach that integrates both geometry and image synthesis in an iterative `\\emph{render}, \\emph{refine} and \\emph{repeat}' framework, allowing for long-range generation that cover large distances after hundreds of frames. Our approach can be trained from a set of monocular video sequences. We propose a dataset of aerial footage of coastal scenes, and compare our method with recent view synthesis and conditional video generation baselines, showing that it can generate plausible scenes for much longer time horizons over large camera trajectories compared to existing methods.

Specifically, the challenge includes very low resolution of the objects, MPEG artifacts due to compression and a large searching area with many hard negatives. Tracking is equally difficult because of the unreliable appearance, and the unreliable motion estimation. Luckily, we found that by combining this two challenging tasks together, there will be mutual benefits. Following the idea, in this paper, we present a neural network model called the Recurrent Correlational Network, where detection and tracking are jointly performed over a multi-frame representation learned through a single, trainable, and end-to-end network. The framework exploits a convolutional long short-term memory network for learning informative appearance changes for detection, while the learned representation is shared in tracking for enhancing its performance. In experiments with datasets containing images of scenes with small flying objects, such as birds and unmanned aerial vehicles, the proposed method yielded consistent improvements in detection performance over deep single-frame detectors and existing motion-based detectors. Furthermore, our network performs as well as state-of-the-art generic object trackers when it was evaluated as a tracker on a bird image dataset.", "label": 1}

First, the cost for pre-training is expensive. Second, there is no efficient way to handle the data noise which degrades model performance. Third, previous methods only leverage limited image-text paired data, while ignoring richer single-modal data, which may result in poor generalization to single-modal downstream tasks. In this work, we propose an EfficientCLIP method via Ensemble Confident Learning to obtain a less noisy data subset. Extra rich non-paired single-modal text data is used for boosting the generalization of text branch. We achieve the state-of-the-art performance on Chinese cross-modal retrieval tasks with only 1/10 training resources compared to CLIP and WenLan, while showing excellent generalization to single-modal tasks, including text retrieval and text classification.", "label": 1}

In contrast, a coarse shape may be easy to acquire in many scenarios (e.g., via low-resolution physically-based simulation, linear blend skinning driven by skeletal motion, portable scanners). In this paper, we show how to enhance, in a data-driven manner, rich yet plausible details starting from a coarse garment geometry. Once the parameterization of the garment is given, we formulate the task as a style transfer problem over the space of associated normal maps. In order to facilitate generalization across garment types and character motions, we introduce a patch-based formulation, that produces high-resolution details by matching a Gram matrix based style loss, to hallucinate geometric details (i.e., wrinkle density and shape). We extensively evaluate our method on a variety of production scenarios and show that our method is simple, light-weight, efficient, and generalizes across underlying garment types, sewing patterns, and body motion.", "label": 1}

Unfortunately, these methods often suffer from overfitting or under-fitting when fine-tuned with a single target image. To address this, here we present a novel single-shot GAN adaptation method through unified CLIP space manipulations. Specifically, our model employs a two-step training strategy: reference image search in the source generator using a CLIP-guided latent optimization, followed by generator fine-tuning with a novel loss function that imposes CLIP space consistency between the source and adapted generators. To further improve the adapted model to produce spatially consistent samples with respect to the source generator, we also propose contrastive regularization for patchwise relationships in the CLIP space. Experimental results show that our model generates diverse outputs with the target texture and outperforms the baseline models both qualitatively and quantitatively. Furthermore, we show that our CLIP space manipulation strategy allows more effective attribute editing.", "label": 1}

We explore the effects of contrastive learning from larger, less-curated image datasets such as YFCC, and find there is indeed a large difference in the resulting representation quality. We hypothesize that this curation gap is due to a shift in the distribution of image classes -- which is more diverse and heavy-tailed -- resulting in less relevant negative samples to learn from. We test this hypothesis with a new approach, Divide and Contrast (DnC), which alternates between contrastive learning and clustering-based hard negative mining. When pretrained on less curated datasets, DnC greatly improves the performance of self-supervised learning on downstream tasks, while remaining competitive with the current state-of-the-art on curated datasets.", "label": 1}

Existing pencil sketch algorithms are based on texture rendering rather than the direct imitation of strokes, making them unable to show the drawing process but only a final result. To address this challenge, we first establish a pencil stroke imitation mechanism. Next, we develop a framework with three branches to guide stroke drawing: the first branch guides the direction of the strokes, the second branch determines the shade of the strokes, and the third branch enhances the details further. Under this framework's guidance, we can produce a pencil sketch by drawing one stroke every time. Our method is fully interpretable. Comparison with existing pencil drawing algorithms shows that our method is superior to others in terms of texture quality, style, and user evaluation.", "label": 1}

However, these models are ill-suited for specialized tasks like story visualization, which requires an agent to produce a sequence of images given a corresponding sequence of captions, forming a narrative. Moreover, we find that the story visualization task fails to accommodate generalization to unseen plots and characters in new narratives. Hence, we first propose the task of story continuation, where the generated visual story is conditioned on a source image, allowing for better generalization to narratives with new characters. Then, we enhance or 'retro-fit' the pretrained text-to-image synthesis models with task-specific modules for (a) sequential image generation and (b) copying relevant elements from an initial frame. Then, we explore full-model finetuning, as well as prompt-based tuning for parameter-efficient adaptation, of the pre-trained model. We evaluate our approach StoryDALL-E on two existing datasets, PororoSV and FlintstonesSV, and introduce a new dataset DiDeMoSV collected from a video-captioning dataset. We also develop a model StoryGANc based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for story continuation, and compare it with the StoryDALL-E model to demonstrate the advantages of our approach. We show that our retro-fitting approach outperforms GAN-based models for story continuation and facilitates copying of visual elements from the source image, thereby improving continuity in the generated visual story. Finally, our analysis suggests that pretrained transformers struggle to comprehend narratives containing several characters. Overall, our work demonstrates that pretrained text-to-image synthesis models can be adapted for complex and low-resource tasks like story continuation.", "label": 1}

Yu, Stephen Lin\nAbstract: Humans can easily segment moving objects without knowing what they are. That objectness could emerge from continuous visual observations motivates us to model grouping and movement concurrently from unlabeled videos. Our premise is that a video has different views of the same scene related by moving components, and the right region segmentation and region flow would allow mutual view synthesis which can be checked from the data itself without any external supervision. Our model starts with two separate pathways: an appearance pathway that outputs feature-based region segmentation for a single image, and a motion pathway that outputs motion features for a pair of images. It then binds them in a conjoint representation called segment flow that pools flow offsets over each region and provides a gross characterization of moving regions for the entire scene. By training the model to minimize view synthesis errors based on segment flow, our appearance and motion pathways learn region segmentation and flow estimation automatically without building them up from low-level edges or optical flows respectively. Our model demonstrates the surprising emergence of objectness in the appearance pathway, surpassing prior works on zero-shot object segmentation from an image, moving object segmentation from a video with unsupervised test-time adaptation, and semantic image segmentation by supervised fine-tuning. Our work is the first truly end-to-end zero-shot object segmentation from videos. It not only develops generic objectness for segmentation and tracking, but also outperforms prevalent image-based contrastive learning methods without augmentation engineering.", "label": 1}

That is highly inefficient and for large datasets implies a massive redundancy of features detectors. Even though capsules networks are still in their infancy, they constitute a promising solution to extend current convolutional networks and endow artificial visual perception with a process to encode more efficiently all feature affine transformations. Indeed, a properly working capsule network should theoretically achieve higher results with a considerably lower number of parameters count due to intrinsic capability to generalize to novel viewpoints. Nevertheless, little attention has been given to this relevant aspect. In this paper, we investigate the efficiency of capsule networks and, pushing their capacity to the limits with an extreme architecture with barely 160K parameters, we prove that the proposed architecture is still able to achieve state-of-the-art results on three different datasets with only 2% of the original CapsNet parameters. Moreover, we replace dynamic routing with a novel non-iterative, highly parallelizable routing algorithm that can easily cope with a reduced number of capsules.

In this paper we propose a new model architecture DeBERTa (Decoding-enhanced BERT with disentangled attention) that improves the BERT and RoBERTa models using two novel techniques. The first is the disentangled attention mechanism, where each word is represented using two vectors that encode its content and position, respectively, and the attention weights among words are computed using disentangled matrices on their contents and relative positions, respectively. Second, an enhanced mask decoder is used to incorporate absolute positions in the decoding layer to predict the masked tokens in model pre-training. In addition, a new virtual adversarial training method is used for fine-tuning to improve models' generalization. We show that these techniques significantly improve the efficiency of model pre-training and the performance of both natural language understanding (NLU) and natural langauge generation (NLG) downstream tasks. Compared to RoBERTa-Large, a DeBERTa model trained on half of the training data performs consistently better on a wide range of NLP tasks, achieving improvements on MNLI by +0.9% (90.2% vs. 91.1%), on SQuAD v2.0 by +2.3% (88.4% vs. 90.7%) and RACE by +3.6% (83.2% vs. 86.8%). Notably, we scale up DeBERTa by training a larger version that consists of 48 Transform layers with 1.5 billion parameters. The significant performance boost makes the single DeBERTa model surpass the human performance on the SuperGLUE benchmark (Wang et al., 2019a) for the first time in terms of macro-average score (89.9 versus 89.8), and the ensemble DeBERTa model sits atop the SuperGLUE leaderboard as of January 6, 2021, out performing the human baseline by a decent margin (90.3 versus 89.8).", "label": 1}
{"text": "Title: Object Representations as Fixed Points: Training Iterative Refinement Algorithms with Implicit Differentiation\nAuthors: Michael Chang, Thomas L. Griffiths, Sergey Levine\nAbstract: Iterative refinement -- start with a random guess, then iteratively improve the guess -- is a useful paradigm for representation learning because it offers a way to break symmetries among equally plausible explanations for the data. This property enables the application of such methods to infer representations of sets of entities, such as objects in physical scenes, structurally resembling clustering algorithms in latent space. However, most prior works differentiate through the unrolled refinement process, which can make optimization challenging. We observe that such methods can be made differentiable by means of the implicit function theorem, and develop an implicit differentiation approach that improves the stability and tractability of training by decoupling the forward and backward passes. This connection enables us to apply advances in optimizing implicit layers to not only improve the optimization of the slot attention module in SLATE, a state-of-the-art method for learning entity representations, but do so with constant space and time complexity in backpropagation and only one additional line of code.", "label": 1}

Recent emergence of Transformer networks, which replace convolution layers with self-attention blocks, has revealed the limitation of stationary convolution kernels and opened the door to the era of dynamic feature transforms. The existing dynamic transforms, including self-attention, however, are all limited for video understanding where correspondence relations in space and time, i.e., motion information, are crucial for effective representation. In this work, we introduce a relational feature transform, dubbed the relational self-attention (RSA), that leverages rich structures of spatio-temporal relations in videos by dynamically generating relational kernels and aggregating relational contexts. Our experiments and ablation studies show that the RSA network substantially outperforms convolution and self-attention counterparts, achieving the state of the art on the standard motion-centric benchmarks for video action recognition, such as Something-Something-V1 & V2, Diving48, and FineGym.", "label": 1}

By just replacing the spatial convolutions with global self-attention in the final three bottleneck blocks of a ResNet and no other changes, our approach improves upon the baselines significantly on instance segmentation and object detection while also reducing the parameters, with minimal overhead in latency. Through the design of BoTNet, we also point out how ResNet bottleneck blocks with self-attention can be viewed as Transformer blocks. Without any bells and whistles, BoTNet achieves 44.4% Mask AP and 49.7% Box AP on the COCO Instance Segmentation benchmark using the Mask R-CNN framework; surpassing the previous best published single model and single scale results of ResNeSt evaluated on the COCO validation set. Finally, we present a simple adaptation of the BoTNet design for image classification, resulting in models that achieve a strong performance of 84.7% top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet benchmark while being up to 1.64x faster in compute time than the popular EfficientNet models on TPU-v3 hardware. We hope our simple and effective approach will serve as a strong baseline for future research in self-attention models for vision", "label": 1}

At the same time, it is known from the neuroscience literature that human visual system (HVS) is tailored to process asynchronous brightness changes rather than synchronous RGB images, in order to build and continuously update mental 3D representations of the surroundings for navigation and survival. Visual sensors that were inspired by HVS principles are event cameras. Thus, events are sparse and asynchronous per-pixel brightness (or colour channel) change signals. In contrast to existing works on neural 3D scene representation learning, this paper approaches the problem from a new perspective. We demonstrate that it is possible to learn NeRF suitable for novel-view synthesis in the RGB space from asynchronous event streams. Our models achieve high visual accuracy of the rendered novel views of challenging scenes in the RGB space, even though they are trained with substantially fewer data (i.e., event streams from a single event camera moving around the object) and more efficiently (due to the inherent sparsity of event streams) than the existing NeRF models trained with RGB images. We will release our datasets and the source code, see https://4dqv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/EventNeRF/.", "label": 1}

Efros, Jingwan Lu\nAbstract: Due to the ubiquity of smartphones, it is popular to take photos of one's self, or \"selfies.\" Such photos are convenient to take, because they do not require specialized equipment or a third-party photographer. However, in selfies, constraints such as human arm length often make the body pose look unnatural. To address this issue, we introduce $\\textit{unselfie}$, a novel photographic transformation that automatically translates a selfie into a neutral-pose portrait. To achieve this, we first collect an unpaired dataset, and introduce a way to synthesize paired training data for self-supervised learning. Then, to $\\textit{unselfie}$ a photo, we propose a new three-stage pipeline, where we first find a target neutral pose, inpaint the body texture, and finally refine and composite the person on the background. To obtain a suitable target neutral pose, we propose a novel nearest pose search module that makes the reposing task easier and enables the generation of multiple neutral-pose results among which users can choose the best one they like. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations show the superiority of our pipeline over alternatives.", "label": 1}

While some researchers have demonstrated that Transformer-based models enjoy a favorable ability of fitting data, there are still growing number of evidences showing that these models suffer over-fitting especially when the training data is limited. This paper offers an empirical study by performing step-by-step operations to gradually transit a Transformer-based model to a convolution-based model. The results we obtain during the transition process deliver useful messages for improving visual recognition. Based on these observations, we propose a new architecture named Visformer, which is abbreviated from the `Vision-friendly Transformer'. With the same computational complexity, Visformer outperforms both the Transformer-based and convolution-based models in terms of ImageNet classification accuracy, and the advantage becomes more significant when the model complexity is lower or the training set is smaller.

We place a variety of obstacles in the environment for the prey to hide behind, and we only give the agents partial observations of their environment using an egocentric perspective. Although we train the model to play this game from scratch, experiments and visualizations suggest that the agent learns to predict its own visibility in the environment. Furthermore, we quantitatively analyze how agent weaknesses, such as slower speed, effect the learned policy. Our results suggest that, although agent weaknesses make the learning problem more challenging, they also cause more useful features to be learned.

However, the indexing and retrieving of large-scale corpora bring considerable computational cost. Surprisingly, we found that REtrieving from the traINing datA (REINA) only can lead to significant gains on multiple NLG and NLU tasks. We retrieve the labeled training instances most similar to the input text and then concatenate them with the input to feed into the model to generate the output. Experimental results show that this simple method can achieve significantly better performance on a variety of NLU and NLG tasks, including summarization, machine translation, language modeling, and question answering tasks.

{"text": "Title: Closed-Form Factorization of Latent Semantics in GANs\nAuthors: Yujun Shen, Bolei Zhou\nAbstract: A rich set of interpretable dimensions has been shown to emerge in the latent space of the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained for synthesizing images. In order to identify such latent dimensions for image editing, previous methods typically annotate a collection of synthesized samples and train linear classifiers in the latent space. However, they require a clear definition of the target attribute as well as the corresponding manual annotations, limiting their applications in practice. In this work, we examine the internal representation learned by GANs to reveal the underlying variation factors in an unsupervised manner. In particular, we take a closer look into the generation mechanism of GANs and further propose a closed-form factorization algorithm for latent semantic discovery by directly decomposing the pre-trained weights. With a lightning-fast implementation, our approach is capable of not only finding semantically meaningful dimensions comparably to the state-of-the-art supervised methods, but also resulting in far more versatile concepts across multiple GAN models trained on a wide range of datasets.", "label": 1}

If this was achievable, then it would revolutionise Deaf hearing communications. Previous work on predominantly isolated SLP has shown the need for architectures that are better suited to the continuous domain of full sign sequences.   In this paper, we propose Progressive Transformers, a novel architecture that can translate from discrete spoken language sentences to continuous 3D skeleton pose outputs representing sign language. We present two model configurations, an end-to-end network that produces sign direct from text and a stacked network that utilises a gloss intermediary.   Our transformer network architecture introduces a counter that enables continuous sequence generation at training and inference. We also provide several data augmentation processes to overcome the problem of drift and improve the performance of SLP models.

Yu\nAbstract: Sketches are the most abstract 2D representations of real-world objects. Although a sketch usually has geometrical distortion and lacks visual cues, humans can effortlessly envision a 3D object from it. This suggests that sketches encode the information necessary for reconstructing 3D shapes. Despite great progress achieved in 3D reconstruction from distortion-free line drawings, such as CAD and edge maps, little effort has been made to reconstruct 3D shapes from free-hand sketches. We study this task and aim to enhance the power of sketches in 3D-related applications such as interactive design and VR/AR games.   Unlike previous works, which mostly study distortion-free line drawings, our 3D shape reconstruction is based on free-hand sketches. A major challenge for free-hand sketch 3D reconstruction comes from the insufficient training data and free-hand sketch diversity, e.g. individualized sketching styles. We thus propose data generation and standardization mechanisms. Instead of distortion-free line drawings, synthesized sketches are adopted as input training data. Additionally, we propose a sketch standardization module to handle different sketch distortions and styles. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model and its strong generalizability to various free-hand sketches.

In this setting, questions about data efficiency, memorization, generalization, and speed of learning can be studied in great detail. In some situations we show that neural networks learn through a process of \"grokking\" a pattern in the data, improving generalization performance from random chance level to perfect generalization, and that this improvement in generalization can happen well past the point of overfitting. We also study generalization as a function of dataset size and find that smaller datasets require increasing amounts of optimization for generalization. We argue that these datasets provide a fertile ground for studying a poorly understood aspect of deep learning: generalization of overparametrized neural networks beyond memorization of the finite training dataset.", "label": 1}

However, evaluating the fitness of such representations requires training RL algorithms which is computationally intensive and has high variance outcomes. To alleviate this issue, we design an evaluation protocol for unsupervised RL representations with lower variance and up to 600x lower computational cost. Inspired by the vision community, we propose two linear probing tasks: predicting the reward observed in a given state, and predicting the action of an expert in a given state. These two tasks are generally applicable to many RL domains, and we show through rigorous experimentation that they correlate strongly with the actual downstream control performance on the Atari100k Benchmark. This provides a better method for exploring the space of pretraining algorithms without the need of running RL evaluations for every setting. Leveraging this framework, we further improve existing self-supervised learning (SSL) recipes for RL, highlighting the importance of the forward model, the size of the visual backbone, and the precise formulation of the unsupervised objective.", "label": 1}

The method is based on an autoencoder that factors each input image into depth, albedo, viewpoint and illumination. In order to disentangle these components without supervision, we use the fact that many object categories have, at least in principle, a symmetric structure. We show that reasoning about illumination allows us to exploit the underlying object symmetry even if the appearance is not symmetric due to shading. Furthermore, we model objects that are probably, but not certainly, symmetric by predicting a symmetry probability map, learned end-to-end with the other components of the model. Our experiments show that this method can recover very accurately the 3D shape of human faces, cat faces and cars from single-view images, without any supervision or a prior shape model. On benchmarks, we demonstrate superior accuracy compared to another method that uses supervision at the level of 2D image correspondences.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Title: Hierarchical Pyramid Representations for Semantic Segmentation\nAuthors: Hiroaki Aizawa, Yukihiro Domae, Kunihito Kato\nAbstract: Understanding the context of complex and cluttered scenes is a challenging problem for semantic segmentation. However, it is difficult to model the context without prior and additional supervision because the scene's factors, such as the scale, shape, and appearance of objects, vary considerably in these scenes. To solve this, we propose to learn the structures of objects and the hierarchy among objects because context is based on these intrinsic properties. In this study, we design novel hierarchical, contextual, and multiscale pyramidal representations to capture the properties from an input image. Our key idea is the recursive segmentation in different hierarchical regions based on a predefined number of regions and the aggregation of the context in these regions. The aggregated contexts are used to predict the contextual relationship between the regions and partition the regions in the following hierarchical level. Finally, by constructing the pyramid representations from the recursively aggregated context, multiscale and hierarchical properties are attained. In the experiments, we confirmed that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in PASCAL Context.", "label": 1}

Black, Siyu Tang\nAbstract: We present a fully automatic system that takes a 3D scene and generates plausible 3D human bodies that are posed naturally in that 3D scene. Given a 3D scene without people, humans can easily imagine how people could interact with the scene and the objects in it. However, this is a challenging task for a computer as solving it requires that (1) the generated human bodies to be semantically plausible within the 3D environment (e.g. people sitting on the sofa or cooking near the stove), and (2) the generated human-scene interaction to be physically feasible such that the human body and scene do not interpenetrate while, at the same time, body-scene contact supports physical interactions. To that end, we make use of the surface-based 3D human model SMPL-X. We first train a conditional variational autoencoder to predict semantically plausible 3D human poses conditioned on latent scene representations, then we further refine the generated 3D bodies using scene constraints to enforce feasible physical interaction. We show that our approach is able to synthesize realistic and expressive 3D human bodies that naturally interact with 3D environment. We perform extensive experiments demonstrating that our generative framework compares favorably with existing methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively. We believe that our scene-conditioned 3D human generation pipeline will be useful for numerous applications; e.g. to generate training data for human pose estimation, in video games and in VR/AR.

They typically serve as the default architecture in studies, or as baselines when new architectures are proposed. Yet there has been significant progress on best practices for training neural networks since the inception of the ResNet architecture in 2015.

We share competitive training settings and pre-trained models in the timm open-source library, with the hope that they will serve as better baselines for future work. For instance, with our more demanding training setting, a vanilla ResNet-50 reaches 80.4% top-1 accuracy at resolution 224x224 on ImageNet-val without extra data or distillation.

{"text": "Title: MINER: Multiscale Implicit Neural Representations\nAuthors: Vishwanath Saragadam, Jasper Tan, Guha Balakrishnan, Richard G. Baraniuk, Ashok Veeraraghavan\nAbstract: We introduce a new neural signal model designed for efficient high-resolution representation of large-scale signals. The key innovation in our multiscale implicit neural representation (MINER) is an internal representation via a Laplacian pyramid, which provides a sparse multiscale decomposition of the signal that captures orthogonal parts of the signal across scales. We leverage the advantages of the Laplacian pyramid by representing small disjoint patches of the pyramid at each scale with a small MLP. This enables the capacity of the network to adaptively increase from coarse to fine scales, and only represent parts of the signal with strong signal energy. The parameters of each MLP are optimized from coarse-to-fine scale which results in faster approximations at coarser scales, thereby ultimately an extremely fast training process. We apply MINER to a range of large-scale signal representation tasks, including gigapixel images and very large point clouds, and demonstrate that it requires fewer than 25% of the parameters, 33% of the memory footprint, and 10% of the computation time of competing techniques such as ACORN to reach the same representation accuracy.", "label": 1}

Due to curvature, the transport of filter kernels on surfaces results in a rotational ambiguity, which prevents a uniform alignment of these kernels on the surface. We propose a network architecture for surfaces that consists of vector-valued, rotation-equivariant features. The equivariance property makes it possible to locally align features, which were computed in arbitrary coordinate systems, when aggregating features in a convolution layer. The resulting network is agnostic to the choices of coordinate systems for the tangent spaces on the surface. We implement our approach for triangle meshes. Based on circular harmonic functions, we introduce convolution filters for meshes that are rotation-equivariant at the discrete level. We evaluate the resulting networks on shape correspondence and shape classifications tasks and compare their performance to other approaches.", "label": 1}

This naturally leads to the following questions: Can a self-attention layer of ViT express any convolution operation? In this work, we prove that a single ViT layer with image patches as the input can perform any convolution operation constructively, where the multi-head attention mechanism and the relative positional encoding play essential roles.

Existing approaches introduce stochasticity via sampling or modify training objectives to decrease probabilities of certain tokens (e.g., unlikelihood training). However, they often lead to solutions that lack coherence. In this work, we show that an underlying reason for model degeneration is the anisotropic distribution of token representations. We present a contrastive solution: (i) SimCTG, a contrastive training objective to calibrate the model's representation space, and (ii) a decoding method -- contrastive search -- to encourage diversity while maintaining coherence in the generated text.

Moreover, the generated prosody is solely defined by the input text, which does not allow for different styles for the same sentence. In this work, we train a sequence-to-sequence neural network conditioned on acoustic speech features to learn a latent prosody space with intuitive and meaningful dimensions. Experiments show that a model conditioned on sentence-wise pitch, pitch range, phone duration, energy, and spectral tilt can effectively control each prosodic dimension and generate a wide variety of speaking styles, while maintaining similar mean opinion score (4.23) to our Tacotron baseline (4.26).", "label": 1}

In this paper, we propose BinaryBERT, which pushes BERT quantization to the limit by weight binarization. We find that a binary BERT is hard to be trained directly than a ternary counterpart due to its complex and irregular loss landscape. Therefore, we propose ternary weight splitting, which initializes BinaryBERT by equivalently splitting from a half-sized ternary network. The binary model thus inherits the good performance of the ternary one, and can be further enhanced by fine-tuning the new architecture after splitting.

When reducing lengths, we add skip connections to improve performance and stabilize training deeper networks. Second, we propose weight-sharing NAS with multi-architectural sampling. We enlarge a network and utilize its sub-networks to define a search space. A super-network covering all sub-networks is then trained for fast evaluation of their performance.

Learning under such restricted supervision limits the flexibility of models because they require labeled audio for training and can only predict the predefined categories. Instead, we propose to learn audio concepts from natural language supervision. We call our approach Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP), which learns to connect language and audio by using two encoders and a contrastive learning to bring audio and text descriptions into a joint multimodal space. We trained CLAP with 128k audio and text pairs and evaluated it on 16 downstream tasks across 8 domains, such as Sound Event Classification, Music tasks, and Speech-related tasks. Although CLAP was trained with significantly less pairs than similar computer vision models, it establishes SoTA for Zero-Shot performance. Additionally, we evaluated CLAP in a supervised learning setup and achieve SoTA in 5 tasks. Hence, CLAP's Zero-Shot capability removes the need of training with class labels, enables flexible class prediction at inference time, and generalizes to multiple downstream tasks.", "label": 1}

However, the limited discriminability of learned representation manifests there is still plenty to go for making a stronger vision learner. Towards this goal, we propose Contrastive Masked Autoencoders (CMAE), a new self-supervised pre-training method for learning more comprehensive and capable vision representations. By elaboratively unifying contrastive learning (CL) and masked image model (MIM) through novel designs, CMAE leverages their respective advantages and learns representations with both strong instance discriminability and local perceptibility. Specifically, CMAE consists of two branches where the online branch is an asymmetric encoder-decoder and the target branch is a momentum updated encoder. During training, the online encoder reconstructs original images from latent representations of masked images to learn holistic features. The target encoder, fed with the full images, enhances the feature discriminability via contrastive learning with its online counterpart. To make CL compatible with MIM, CMAE introduces two new components, i.e. pixel shift for generating plausible positive views and feature decoder for complementing features of contrastive pairs. Thanks to these novel designs, CMAE effectively improves the representation quality and transfer performance over its MIM counterpart. CMAE achieves the state-of-the-art performance on highly competitive benchmarks of image classification, semantic segmentation and object detection. Notably, CMAE-Base achieves $85.3\\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet and $52.5\\%$ mIoU on ADE20k, surpassing previous best results by $0.7\\%$ and $1.8\\%$ respectively.

The current landscape of transformer models is increasingly diverse: the model size varies drastically with the largest being of hundred-billion parameters; the model characteristics differ due to the sparsity introduced by the Mixture-of-Experts; the target application scenarios can be latency-critical or throughput-oriented; the deployment hardware could be single- or multi-GPU systems with different types of memory and storage, etc. With such increasing diversity and the fast-evolving pace of transformer models, designing a highly performant and efficient inference system is extremely challenging. In this paper, we present DeepSpeed Inference, a comprehensive system solution for transformer model inference to address the above-mentioned challenges. DeepSpeed Inference consists of (1) a multi-GPU inference solution to minimize latency while maximizing the throughput of both dense and sparse transformer models when they fit in aggregate GPU memory, and (2) a heterogeneous inference solution that leverages CPU and NVMe memory in addition to the GPU memory and compute to enable high inference throughput with large models which do not fit in aggregate GPU memory. DeepSpeed Inference reduces latency by up to 7.3X over the state-of-the-art for latency-oriented scenarios and increases throughput by over 1.5x for throughput-oriented scenarios. Moreover, it enables trillion parameter scale inference under real-time latency constraints by leveraging hundreds of GPUs, an unprecedented scale for inference. It can inference 25x larger models than with GPU-only solutions, while delivering a high throughput of 84 TFLOPS (over $50\\%$ of A6000 peak).", "label": 1}
{"text": "Title: Intriguing Properties of Vision Transformers\nAuthors: Muzammal Naseer, Kanchana Ranasinghe, Salman Khan, Munawar Hayat, Fahad Shahbaz Khan, Ming-Hsuan Yang\nAbstract: Vision transformers (ViT) have demonstrated impressive performance across various machine vision problems. These models are based on multi-head self-attention mechanisms that can flexibly attend to a sequence of image patches to encode contextual cues. An important question is how such flexibility in attending image-wide context conditioned on a given patch can facilitate handling nuisances in natural images e.g., severe occlusions, domain shifts, spatial permutations, adversarial and natural perturbations. We systematically study this question via an extensive set of experiments encompassing three ViT families and comparisons with a high-performing convolutional neural network (CNN). We show and analyze the following intriguing properties of ViT: (a) Transformers are highly robust to severe occlusions, perturbations and domain shifts, e.g., retain as high as 60% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet even after randomly occluding 80% of the image content. (b) The robust performance to occlusions is not due to a bias towards local textures, and ViTs are significantly less biased towards textures compared to CNNs. When properly trained to encode shape-based features, ViTs demonstrate shape recognition capability comparable to that of human visual system, previously unmatched in the literature. (c) Using ViTs to encode shape representation leads to an interesting consequence of accurate semantic segmentation without pixel-level supervision. (d) Off-the-shelf features from a single ViT model can be combined to create a feature ensemble, leading to high accuracy rates across a range of classification datasets in both traditional and few-shot learning paradigms. We show effective features of ViTs are due to flexible and dynamic receptive fields possible via the self-attention mechanism.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Title: Megapixel Image Generation with Step-Unrolled Denoising Autoencoders\nAuthors: Alex F. McKinney, Chris G. Willcocks\nAbstract: An ongoing trend in generative modelling research has been to push sample resolutions higher whilst simultaneously reducing computational requirements for training and sampling. We aim to push this trend further via the combination of techniques - each component representing the current pinnacle of efficiency in their respective areas. These include vector-quantized GAN (VQ-GAN), a vector-quantization (VQ) model capable of high levels of lossy - but perceptually insignificant - compression; hourglass transformers, a highly scaleable self-attention model; and step-unrolled denoising autoencoders (SUNDAE), a non-autoregressive (NAR) text generative model. Unexpectedly, our method highlights weaknesses in the original formulation of hourglass transformers when applied to multidimensional data. In light of this, we propose modifications to the resampling mechanism, applicable in any task applying hierarchical transformers to multidimensional data. Additionally, we demonstrate the scalability of SUNDAE to long sequence lengths - four times longer than prior work. Our proposed framework scales to high-resolutions ($1024 \\times 1024$) and trains quickly (2-4 days). Crucially, the trained model produces diverse and realistic megapixel samples in approximately 2 seconds on a consumer-grade GPU (GTX 1080Ti). In general, the framework is flexible: supporting an arbitrary number of sampling steps, sample-wise self-stopping, self-correction capabilities, conditional generation, and a NAR formulation that allows for arbitrary inpainting masks. We obtain FID scores of 10.56 on FFHQ256 - close to the original VQ-GAN in less than half the sampling steps - and 21.85 on FFHQ1024 in only 100 sampling steps.", "label": 1}

A Framework to Improve NLP Accuracy over OCR documents\nAuthors: Amit Gupte, Alexey Romanov, Sahitya Mantravadi, Dalitso Banda, Jianjie Liu, Raza Khan, Lakshmanan Ramu Meenal, Benjamin Han, Soundar Srinivasan\nAbstract: Document digitization is essential for the digital transformation of our societies, yet a crucial step in the process, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), is still not perfect. Even commercial OCR systems can produce questionable output depending on the fidelity of the scanned documents. In this paper, we demonstrate an effective framework for mitigating OCR errors for any downstream NLP task, using Named Entity Recognition (NER) as an example. We first address the data scarcity problem for model training by constructing a document synthesis pipeline, generating realistic but degraded data with NER labels. We measure the NER accuracy drop at various degradation levels and show that a text restoration model, trained on the degraded data, significantly closes the NER accuracy gaps caused by OCR errors, including on an out-of-domain dataset. For the benefit of the community, we have made the document synthesis pipeline available as an open-source project.", "label": 1}

We adopt a hierarchical strategy that uses the correspondence from coarse level to guide the fine levels. At each hierarchy, the correspondence can be efficiently computed via PatchMatch that iteratively leverages the matchings from the neighborhood. Within each PatchMatch iteration, the ConvGRU module is employed to refine the current correspondence considering not only the matchings of larger context but also the historic estimates. The proposed CoCosNet v2, a GRU-assisted PatchMatch approach, is fully differentiable and highly efficient. When jointly trained with image translation, full-resolution semantic correspondence can be established in an unsupervised manner, which in turn facilitates the exemplar-based image translation. Experiments on diverse translation tasks show that CoCosNet v2 performs considerably better than state-of-the-art literature on producing high-resolution images.", "label": 1}

A key component that drives the impressive performance of Transformers is the self-attention mechanism that encodes the influence or dependence of other tokens on each specific token. While beneficial, the quadratic complexity of self-attention on the input sequence length has limited its application to longer sequences -- a topic being actively studied in the community. To address this limitation, we propose Nystr\\\"{o}mformer -- a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a function of sequence length. Our idea is based on adapting the Nystr\\\"{o}m method to approximate standard self-attention with $O(n)$ complexity. The scalability of Nystr\\\"{o}mformer enables application to longer sequences with thousands of tokens. We perform evaluations on multiple downstream tasks on the GLUE benchmark and IMDB reviews with standard sequence length, and find that our Nystr\\\"{o}mformer performs comparably, or in a few cases, even slightly better, than standard self-attention. On longer sequence tasks in the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark, Nystr\\\"{o}mformer performs favorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods.

{"text": "Title: Open-Set Recognition: a Good Closed-Set Classifier is All You Need?\nAuthors: Sagar Vaze, Kai Han, Andrea Vedaldi, Andrew Zisserman\nAbstract: The ability to identify whether or not a test sample belongs to one of the semantic classes in a classifier's training set is critical to practical deployment of the model. This task is termed open-set recognition (OSR) and has received significant attention in recent years. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the ability of a classifier to make the 'none-of-above' decision is highly correlated with its accuracy on the closed-set classes. We find that this relationship holds across loss objectives and architectures, and further demonstrate the trend both on the standard OSR benchmarks as well as on a large-scale ImageNet evaluation. Second, we use this correlation to boost the performance of a maximum logit score OSR 'baseline' by improving its closed-set accuracy, and with this strong baseline achieve state-of-the-art on a number of OSR benchmarks. Similarly, we boost the performance of the existing state-of-the-art method by improving its closed-set accuracy, but the resulting discrepancy with the strong baseline is marginal. Our third contribution is to present the 'Semantic Shift Benchmark' (SSB), which better respects the task of detecting semantic novelty, in contrast to other forms of distribution shift also considered in related sub-fields, such as out-of-distribution detection. On this new evaluation, we again demonstrate that there is negligible difference between the strong baseline and the existing state-of-the-art.

{"text": "Title: Reinforcement Learning with Prototypical Representations\nAuthors: Denis Yarats, Rob Fergus, Alessandro Lazaric, Lerrel Pinto\nAbstract: Learning effective representations in image-based environments is crucial for sample efficient Reinforcement Learning (RL). Unfortunately, in RL, representation learning is confounded with the exploratory experience of the agent -- learning a useful representation requires diverse data, while effective exploration is only possible with coherent representations. Furthermore, we would like to learn representations that not only generalize across tasks but also accelerate downstream exploration for efficient task-specific training. To address these challenges we propose Proto-RL, a self-supervised framework that ties representation learning with exploration through prototypical representations. These prototypes simultaneously serve as a summarization of the exploratory experience of an agent as well as a basis for representing observations. We pre-train these task-agnostic representations and prototypes on environments without downstream task information. This enables state-of-the-art downstream policy learning on a set of difficult continuous control tasks.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: QuadTree Attention for Vision Transformers\nAuthors: Shitao Tang, Jiahui Zhang, Siyu Zhu, Ping Tan\nAbstract: Transformers have been successful in many vision tasks, thanks to their capability of capturing long-range dependency. However, their quadratic computational complexity poses a major obstacle for applying them to vision tasks requiring dense predictions, such as object detection, feature matching, stereo, etc. We introduce QuadTree Attention, which reduces the computational complexity from quadratic to linear. Our quadtree transformer builds token pyramids and computes attention in a coarse-to-fine manner. At each level, the top K patches with the highest attention scores are selected, such that at the next level, attention is only evaluated within the relevant regions corresponding to these top K patches. We demonstrate that quadtree attention achieves state-of-the-art performance in various vision tasks, e.g. with 4.0% improvement in feature matching on ScanNet, about 50% flops reduction in stereo matching, 0.4-1.5% improvement in top-1 accuracy on ImageNet classification, 1.2-1.8% improvement on COCO object detection, and 0.7-2.4% improvement on semantic segmentation over previous state-of-the-art transformers.

In this work, we propose Additive Focal Variational Auto-encoder (AF-VAE), a novel approach that can arbitrarily manipulate high-resolution face images using a simple yet effective model and only weak supervision of reconstruction and KL divergence losses. First, a novel additive Gaussian Mixture assumption is introduced with an unsupervised clustering mechanism in the structural latent space, which endows better disentanglement and boosts multi-modal representation with external memory. Second, to improve the perceptual quality of synthesized results, two simple strategies in architecture design are further tailored and discussed on the behavior of Human Visual System (HVS) for the first time, allowing for fine control over the model complexity and sample quality. Human opinion studies and new state-of-the-art Inception Score (IS) / Frechet Inception Distance (FID) demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing algorithms, advancing both the fidelity and extremity of face manipulation task.", "label": 1}

We propose a novel framework for PVG that is trained in a self-supervised manner on a large dataset of unlabelled videos. We employ an encoder-decoder architecture where the predicted action labels act as bottleneck. The network is constrained to learn a rich action space using, as main driving loss, a reconstruction loss on the generated video.

To circumvent the tedious and computationally expensive tasks of modeling, rendering and compositing the 3D geometry of the target hairstyle using the traditional graphics pipeline, we employ a neural network pipeline that synthesizes realistic and detailed images of facial hair directly in the target image in under one second. The synthesis is controlled by simple and sparse guide strokes from the user defining the general structural and color properties of the target hairstyle. We qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate our chosen method compared to several alternative approaches. We show compelling interactive editing results with a prototype user interface that allows novice users to progressively refine the generated image to match their desired hairstyle, and demonstrate that our approach also allows for flexible and high-fidelity scalp hair synthesis.", "label": 1}

Taylor, Michal Drozdzal\nAbstract: Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) are finding increasingly widespread use in many application domains. Despite outstanding progress, quantitative evaluation of such models often involves multiple distinct metrics to assess different desirable properties, such as image quality, conditional consistency, and intra-conditioning diversity. In this setting, model benchmarking becomes a challenge, as each metric may indicate a different \"best\" model. In this paper, we propose the Frechet Joint Distance (FJD), which is defined as the Frechet distance between joint distributions of images and conditioning, allowing it to implicitly capture the aforementioned properties in a single metric. We conduct proof-of-concept experiments on a controllable synthetic dataset, which consistently highlight the benefits of FJD when compared to currently established metrics. Moreover, we use the newly introduced metric to compare existing cGAN-based models for a variety of conditioning modalities (e.g. class labels, object masks, bounding boxes, images, and text captions). We show that FJD can be used as a promising single metric for cGAN benchmarking and model selection. Code can be found at https://github.com/facebookresearch/fjd.", "label": 1}

Unlike prior methods, our approach has the ability to learn from past experience and improve over time. In particular, as we train over a greater number of chip blocks, our method becomes better at rapidly generating optimized placements for previously unseen chip blocks. To achieve these results, we pose placement as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem and train an agent to place the nodes of a chip netlist onto a chip canvas. To enable our RL policy to generalize to unseen blocks, we ground representation learning in the supervised task of predicting placement quality. By designing a neural architecture that can accurately predict reward across a wide variety of netlists and their placements, we are able to generate rich feature embeddings of the input netlists. We then use this architecture as the encoder of our policy and value networks to enable transfer learning. Our objective is to minimize PPA (power, performance, and area), and we show that, in under 6 hours, our method can generate placements that are superhuman or comparable on modern accelerator netlists, whereas existing baselines require human experts in the loop and take several weeks.", "label": 1}

Here, we introduce Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (D3PMs), diffusion-like generative models for discrete data that generalize the multinomial diffusion model of Hoogeboom et al. 2021, by going beyond corruption processes with uniform transition probabilities. This includes corruption with transition matrices that mimic Gaussian kernels in continuous space, matrices based on nearest neighbors in embedding space, and matrices that introduce absorbing states. The third allows us to draw a connection between diffusion models and autoregressive and mask-based generative models. We show that the choice of transition matrix is an important design decision that leads to improved results in image and text domains. We also introduce a new loss function that combines the variational lower bound with an auxiliary cross entropy loss.

In this work, we innovatively propose ConTNet (ConvolutionTransformer Network), combining transformer with ConvNet architectures to provide large receptive fields. Unlike the recently-proposed transformer-based models (e.g., ViT, DeiT) that are sensitive to hyper-parameters and extremely dependent on a pile of data augmentations when trained from scratch on a midsize dataset (e.g., ImageNet1k), ConTNet can be optimized like normal ConvNets (e.g., ResNet) and preserve an outstanding robustness. It is also worth pointing that, given identical strong data augmentations, the performance improvement of ConTNet is more remarkable than that of ResNet. We present its superiority and effectiveness on image classification and downstream tasks. For example, our ConTNet achieves 81.8% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet which is the same as DeiT-B with less than 40% computational complexity.

A forward model of the world supervises a driving policy that predicts the outcome of any potential driving trajectory. To support learning from pre-recorded logs, we assume that the world is on rails, meaning neither the agent nor its actions influence the environment. This assumption greatly simplifies the learning problem, factorizing the dynamics into a nonreactive world model and a low-dimensional and compact forward model of the ego-vehicle. Our approach computes action-values for each training trajectory using a tabular dynamic-programming evaluation of the Bellman equations; these action-values in turn supervise the final vision-based driving policy. Despite the world-on-rails assumption, the final driving policy acts well in a dynamic and reactive world. At the time of writing, our method ranks first on the CARLA leaderboard, attaining a 25% higher driving score while using 40 times less data. Our method is also an order of magnitude more sample-efficient than state-of-the-art model-free reinforcement learning techniques on navigational tasks in the ProcGen benchmark.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: DCT-Net: Domain-Calibrated Translation for Portrait Stylization\nAuthors: Yifang Men, Yuan Yao, Miaomiao Cui, Zhouhui Lian, Xuansong Xie\nAbstract: This paper introduces DCT-Net, a novel image translation architecture for few-shot portrait stylization. Given limited style exemplars ($\\sim$100), the new architecture can produce high-quality style transfer results with advanced ability to synthesize high-fidelity contents and strong generality to handle complicated scenes (e.g., occlusions and accessories). Moreover, it enables full-body image translation via one elegant evaluation network trained by partial observations (i.e., stylized heads). Few-shot learning based style transfer is challenging since the learned model can easily become overfitted in the target domain, due to the biased distribution formed by only a few training examples. This paper aims to handle the challenge by adopting the key idea of \"calibration first, translation later\" and exploring the augmented global structure with locally-focused translation. Specifically, the proposed DCT-Net consists of three modules: a content adapter borrowing the powerful prior from source photos to calibrate the content distribution of target samples; a geometry expansion module using affine transformations to release spatially semantic constraints; and a texture translation module leveraging samples produced by the calibrated distribution to learn a fine-grained conversion. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method's superiority over the state of the art in head stylization and its effectiveness on full image translation with adaptive deformations.", "label": 1}

This paper proposes a non-autoregressive neural text-to-speech model augmented with a variational autoencoder-based residual encoder. This model, called \\emph{Parallel Tacotron}, is highly parallelizable during both training and inference, allowing efficient synthesis on modern parallel hardware. The use of the variational autoencoder relaxes the one-to-many mapping nature of the text-to-speech problem and improves naturalness. To further improve the naturalness, we use lightweight convolutions, which can efficiently capture local contexts, and introduce an iterative spectrogram loss inspired by iterative refinement. Experimental results show that Parallel Tacotron matches a strong autoregressive baseline in subjective evaluations with significantly decreased inference time.", "label": 1}

We firstly analyze the drawback of current sentence embedding from original BERT and find that it is mainly due to the static token embedding bias and ineffective BERT layers. Then we propose the first prompt-based sentence embeddings method and discuss two prompt representing methods and three prompt searching methods to make BERT achieve better sentence embeddings. Moreover, we propose a novel unsupervised training objective by the technology of template denoising, which substantially shortens the performance gap between the supervised and unsupervised settings.

{"text": "Title: Temporal Difference Learning for Model Predictive Control\nAuthors: Nicklas Hansen, Xiaolong Wang, Hao Su\nAbstract: Data-driven model predictive control has two key advantages over model-free methods: a potential for improved sample efficiency through model learning, and better performance as computational budget for planning increases. However, it is both costly to plan over long horizons and challenging to obtain an accurate model of the environment. In this work, we combine the strengths of model-free and model-based methods. We use a learned task-oriented latent dynamics model for local trajectory optimization over a short horizon, and use a learned terminal value function to estimate long-term return, both of which are learned jointly by temporal difference learning. Our method, TD-MPC, achieves superior sample efficiency and asymptotic performance over prior work on both state and image-based continuous control tasks from DMControl and Meta-World.

Stereo 360{\\deg} imagery can be captured from multi-camera systems for virtual reality (VR), but lacks motion parallax and correct-in-all-directions disparity cues. Together, these can quickly lead to VR sickness when viewing content. One solution is to try and generate a format suitable for 6DoF rendering, such as by estimating depth. However, this raises questions as to how to handle disoccluded regions in dynamic scenes. Our approach is to simultaneously learn depth and disocclusions via a multi-sphere image representation, which can be rendered with correct 6DoF disparity and motion parallax in VR. This significantly improves comfort for the viewer, and can be inferred and rendered in real time on modern GPU hardware. Together, these move towards making VR video a more comfortable immersive medium.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Title: An Effective Loss Function for Generating 3D Models from Single 2D Image without Rendering\nAuthors: Nikola Zubi\u0107, Pietro Li\u00f2\nAbstract: Differentiable rendering is a very successful technique that applies to a Single-View 3D Reconstruction. Current renderers use losses based on pixels between a rendered image of some 3D reconstructed object and ground-truth images from given matched viewpoints to optimise parameters of the 3D shape.   These models require a rendering step, along with visibility handling and evaluation of the shading model. The main goal of this paper is to demonstrate that we can avoid these steps and still get reconstruction results as other state-of-the-art models that are equal or even better than existing category-specific reconstruction methods. First, we use the same CNN architecture for the prediction of a point cloud shape and pose prediction like the one used by Insafutdinov & Dosovitskiy. Secondly, we propose the novel effective loss function that evaluates how well the projections of reconstructed 3D point clouds cover the ground truth object's silhouette. Then we use Poisson Surface Reconstruction to transform the reconstructed point cloud into a 3D mesh. Finally, we perform a GAN-based texture mapping on a particular 3D mesh and produce a textured 3D mesh from a single 2D image. We evaluate our method on different datasets (including ShapeNet, CUB-200-2011, and Pascal3D+) and achieve state-of-the-art results, outperforming all the other supervised and unsupervised methods and 3D representations, all in terms of performance, accuracy, and training time.", "label": 1}

SR3 adapts denoising diffusion probabilistic models to conditional image generation and performs super-resolution through a stochastic denoising process. Inference starts with pure Gaussian noise and iteratively refines the noisy output using a U-Net model trained on denoising at various noise levels. SR3 exhibits strong performance on super-resolution tasks at different magnification factors, on faces and natural images. We conduct human evaluation on a standard 8X face super-resolution task on CelebA-HQ, comparing with SOTA GAN methods. SR3 achieves a fool rate close to 50%, suggesting photo-realistic outputs, while GANs do not exceed a fool rate of 34%.

The method first samples the surface using non-differentiable rasterization, then applies differentiable, depth-aware point splatting to produce the final image. Our approach requires no differentiable meshing or rasterization steps, making it efficient for large 3D models and applicable to isosurfaces extracted from implicit surface definitions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for implicit-, mesh-, and parametric-surface-based inverse rendering and neural-network training applications. In particular, we show for the first time efficient, differentiable rendering of an isosurface extracted from a neural radiance field (NeRF), and demonstrate surface-based, rather than volume-based, rendering of a NeRF.", "label": 1}

Using an off-the-shelf deep reinforcement learning algorithm, we trained a neural network to control a jumping quadruped robot while solely using its limbs for attitude control. We present tasks of increasing complexity leading to a combination of three-dimensional (re-)orientation and landing locomotion behaviors of a quadruped robot traversing simulated low-gravity celestial bodies. We show that our approach easily generalizes across these tasks and successfully trains policies for each case.

Agnostic of this process, today's language models are trained to generate only the final result. As a consequence, they lack several abilities crucial for collaborative writing: They are unable to update existing texts, difficult to control and incapable of verbally planning or explaining their actions. To address these shortcomings, we introduce PEER, a collaborative language model that is trained to imitate the entire writing process itself: PEER can write drafts, add suggestions, propose edits and provide explanations for its actions. Crucially, we train multiple instances of PEER able to infill various parts of the writing process, enabling the use of self-training techniques for increasing the quality, amount and diversity of training data. This unlocks PEER's full potential by making it applicable in domains for which no edit histories are available and improving its ability to follow instructions, to write useful comments, and to explain its actions. We show that PEER achieves strong performance across various domains and editing tasks.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Title: The Effects of Regularization and Data Augmentation are Class Dependent\nAuthors: Randall Balestriero, Leon Bottou, Yann LeCun\nAbstract: Regularization is a fundamental technique to prevent over-fitting and to improve generalization performances by constraining a model's complexity. Current Deep Networks heavily rely on regularizers such as Data-Augmentation (DA) or weight-decay, and employ structural risk minimization, i.e. cross-validation, to select the optimal regularization hyper-parameters. In this study, we demonstrate that techniques such as DA or weight decay produce a model with a reduced complexity that is unfair across classes. The optimal amount of DA or weight decay found from cross-validation leads to disastrous model performances on some classes e.g. on Imagenet with a resnet50, the \"barn spider\" classification test accuracy falls from $68\\%$ to $46\\%$ only by introducing random crop DA during training. Even more surprising, such performance drop also appears when introducing uninformative regularization techniques such as weight decay. Those results demonstrate that our search for ever increasing generalization performance -- averaged over all classes and samples -- has left us with models and regularizers that silently sacrifice performances on some classes. This scenario can become dangerous when deploying a model on downstream tasks e.g. an Imagenet pre-trained resnet50 deployed on INaturalist sees its performances fall from $70\\%$ to $30\\%$ on class \\#8889 when introducing random crop DA during the Imagenet pre-training phase. Those results demonstrate that designing novel regularizers without class-dependent bias remains an open research question.", "label": 1}

Although computationally efficient, the recent Adapters often increase parameters (e.g. bottleneck dimension) for matching the performance of full model fine-tuning, which we argue goes against their original intention. In this work, we re-examine the parameter-efficiency of Adapters through the lens of network pruning (we name such plug-in concept as \\texttt{SparseAdapter}) and find that SparseAdapter can achieve comparable or better performance than standard Adapters when the sparse ratio reaches up to 80\\%. Based on our findings, we introduce an easy but effective setting ``\\textit{Large-Sparse}'' to improve the model capacity of Adapters under the same parameter budget. Experiments on five competitive Adapters upon three advanced PLMs show that with proper sparse method (e.g. SNIP) and ratio (e.g. 40\\%) SparseAdapter can consistently outperform their corresponding counterpart. Encouragingly, with the \\textit{Large-Sparse} setting, we can obtain further appealing gains, even outperforming the full fine-tuning by a large margin.

Recently, learning-based evaluation metrics have achieved state-of-the-art performance in open-domain dialogue evaluation. However, these metrics, which only focus on a few qualities, are hard to evaluate dialogue comprehensively. Furthermore, these metrics lack an effective score composition approach for diverse evaluation qualities. To address the above problems, we propose a Multi-Metric Evaluation based on Correlation Re-Scaling (MME-CRS) for evaluating open-domain dialogue. Firstly, we build an evaluation metric composed of 5 groups of parallel sub-metrics called Multi-Metric Evaluation (MME) to evaluate the quality of dialogue comprehensively. Furthermore, we propose a novel score composition method called Correlation Re-Scaling (CRS) to model the relationship between sub-metrics and diverse qualities. Our approach MME-CRS ranks first on the final test data of DSTC10 track5 subtask1 Automatic Open-domain Dialogue Evaluation Challenge with a large margin, which proved the effectiveness of our proposed approach.", "label": 0}

Humans are slow at answering this, since discovering patterns might require tediously reading through hundreds of samples. We propose to automatically summarize the differences by \"learning a natural language hypothesis\": given two distributions $D_{0}$ and $D_{1}$, we search for a description that is more often true for $D_{1}$, e.g., \"is military-related.\" To tackle this problem, we fine-tune GPT-3 to propose descriptions with the prompt: \"[samples of $D_{0}$] + [samples of $D_{1}$] + the difference between them is_____.\" We then re-rank the descriptions by checking how often they hold on a larger set of samples with a learned verifier. On a benchmark of 54 real-world binary classification tasks, while GPT-3 Curie (13B) only generates a description similar to human annotation 7% of the time, the performance reaches 61% with fine-tuning and re-ranking, and our best system using GPT-3 Davinci (175B) reaches 76%. We apply our system to describe distribution shifts, debug dataset shortcuts, summarize unknown tasks, and label text clusters, and present analyses based on automatically generated descriptions.", "label": 0}

Moreover, we wish to cover diverse user information needs that may span a multitude of product types. To this end, we first show how the T5 pre-trained Transformer encoder-decoder model can be fine-tuned for the task.

As an alternative, we propose a novel learning-to-diversify (LTD) fine-tuning approach that allows to enrich the language learned by the underlying Transformer model. Our empirical evaluation shows that, using our approach significantly improves the global diversity of the underlying Transformer model, while preserves, as much as possible, its generation relevance.", "label": 0}

Our approach is to expand the abbreviations into full-phrase options by leveraging conversation context with the power of pretrained large language models (LLMs). Through zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning experiments on four public conversation datasets, we show that for replies to the initial turn of a dialog, an LLM with 64B parameters is able to exactly expand over 70% of phrases with abbreviation length up to 10, leading to an effective keystroke saving rate of up to about 77% on these exact expansions. Including a small amount of context in the form of a single conversation turn more than doubles abbreviation expansion accuracies compared to having no context, an effect that is more pronounced for longer phrases. Additionally, the robustness of models against typo noise can be enhanced through fine-tuning on noisy data.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: On the Evaluation of the Plausibility and Faithfulness of Sentiment Analysis Explanations\nAuthors: Julia El Zini, Mohamad Mansour, Basel Mousi, Mariette Awad\nAbstract: Current Explainable AI (ExAI) methods, especially in the NLP field, are conducted on various datasets by employing different metrics to evaluate several aspects. The lack of a common evaluation framework is hindering the progress tracking of such methods and their wider adoption. In this work, inspired by offline information retrieval, we propose different metrics and techniques to evaluate the explainability of SA models from two angles. First, we evaluate the strength of the extracted \"rationales\" in faithfully explaining the predicted outcome. Second, we measure the agreement between ExAI methods and human judgment on a homegrown dataset1 to reflect on the rationales plausibility. Our conducted experiments comprise four dimensions: (1) the underlying architectures of SA models, (2) the approach followed by the ExAI method, (3) the reasoning difficulty, and (4) the homogeneity of the ground-truth rationales. We empirically demonstrate that anchors explanations are more aligned with the human judgment and can be more confident in extracting supporting rationales. As can be foreseen, the reasoning complexity of sentiment is shown to thwart ExAI methods from extracting supporting evidence. Moreover, a remarkable discrepancy is discerned between the results of different explainability methods on the various architectures suggesting the need for consolidation to observe enhanced performance. Predominantly, transformers are shown to exhibit better explainability than convolutional and recurrent architectures. Our work paves the way towards designing more interpretable NLP models and enabling a common evaluation ground for their relative strengths and robustness.", "label": 0}

Rapport engendered with a teachable agent while instructing domain material has been shown to promote learning. Past work on lexical alignment in the field of education suffers from limitations in both the measures used to quantify alignment and the types of interactions in which alignment with agents has been studied.

In this work, we study the problem of language grounding for autonomous vehicles, which aims to localize a region in a visual scene according to a natural language command from a passenger. Prior work only employs the top layer representations of a vision-and-language pre-trained model to predict the region referred to by the command. However, such a method omits the useful features encoded in other layers, and thus results in inadequate understanding of the input scene and command. To tackle this limitation, we present the first layer fusion approach for this task. Since different visual regions may require distinct types of features to disambiguate them from each other, we further propose the region-specific dynamic (RSD) layer attention to adaptively fuse the multimodal information across layers for each region. Extensive experiments on the Talk2Car benchmark demonstrate that our approach helps predict more accurate regions and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.", "label": 0}

However, in some cases, these adaptations might be too much tuned to the particular problems being addressed. In this article, we show that a very simple idea, to add a direct connection between the input and the output, skipping the recurrent module, leads to an increase of the prediction accuracy in sequence modeling problems related to natural language processing. Experiments carried out on different problems show that the addition of this kind of connection to a recurrent network always improves the results, regardless of the architecture and training-specific details.

On one hand, producing textual content that meets specific requirements is of priority for a model to seamlessly conduct conversations with different groups of people.

These summaries are vital for decision making purposes of the organizations. The perspective of the summary that is required to be created depends on the application of the summaries. With this work, we study the multi-perspective summarization of customer-care conversations between support agents and customers. We observe that there are different heuristics that are associated with summaries of different perspectives, and explore these heuristics to create weak-labeled data for intermediate training of the models before fine-tuning with scarce human annotated summaries. Most importantly, we show that our approach supports models to generate multi-perspective summaries with a very small amount of annotated data. For example, our approach achieves 94\\% of the performance (Rouge-2) of a model trained with the original data, by training only with 7\\% of the original data.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: A Transformer Architecture for Online Gesture Recognition of Mathematical Expressions\nAuthors: Mirco Ramo, Gu\u00e9nol\u00e9 C. M. Silvestre\nAbstract: The Transformer architecture is shown to provide a powerful framework as an end-to-end model for building expression trees from online handwritten gestures corresponding to glyph strokes. In particular, the attention mechanism was successfully used to encode, learn and enforce the underlying syntax of expressions creating latent representations that are correctly decoded to the exact mathematical expression tree, providing robustness to ablated inputs and unseen glyphs. For the first time, the encoder is fed with spatio-temporal data tokens potentially forming an infinitely large vocabulary, which finds applications beyond that of online gesture recognition. A new supervised dataset of online handwriting gestures is provided for training models on generic handwriting recognition tasks and a new metric is proposed for the evaluation of the syntactic correctness of the output expression trees. A small Transformer model suitable for edge inference was successfully trained to an average normalised Levenshtein accuracy of 94%, resulting in valid postfix RPN tree representation for 94% of predictions.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Type-Driven Multi-Turn Corrections for Grammatical Error Correction\nAuthors: Shaopeng Lai, Qingyu Zhou, Jiali Zeng, Zhongli Li, Chao Li, Yunbo Cao, Jinsong Su\nAbstract: Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) aims to automatically detect and correct grammatical errors. In this aspect, dominant models are trained by one-iteration learning while performing multiple iterations of corrections during inference. Previous studies mainly focus on the data augmentation approach to combat the exposure bias, which suffers from two drawbacks. First, they simply mix additionally-constructed training instances and original ones to train models, which fails to help models be explicitly aware of the procedure of gradual corrections. Second, they ignore the interdependence between different types of corrections. In this paper, we propose a Type-Driven Multi-Turn Corrections approach for GEC. Using this approach, from each training instance, we additionally construct multiple training instances, each of which involves the correction of a specific type of errors. Then, we use these additionally-constructed training instances and the original one to train the model in turn. Experimental results and in-depth analysis show that our approach significantly benefits the model training. Particularly, our enhanced model achieves state-of-the-art single-model performance on English GEC benchmarks. We release our code at Github.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Unsupervised Term Extraction for Highly Technical Domains\nAuthors: Francesco Fusco, Peter Staar, Diego Antognini\nAbstract: Term extraction is an information extraction task at the root of knowledge discovery platforms. Developing term extractors that are able to generalize across very diverse and potentially highly technical domains is challenging, as annotations for domains requiring in-depth expertise are scarce and expensive to obtain. In this paper, we describe the term extraction subsystem of a commercial knowledge discovery platform that targets highly technical fields such as pharma, medical, and material science. To be able to generalize across domains, we introduce a fully unsupervised annotator (UA). It extracts terms by combining novel morphological signals from sub-word tokenization with term-to-topic and intra-term similarity metrics, computed using general-domain pre-trained sentence-encoders. The annotator is used to implement a weakly-supervised setup, where transformer-models are fine-tuned (or pre-trained) over the training data generated by running the UA over large unlabeled corpora. Our experiments demonstrate that our setup can improve the predictive performance while decreasing the inference latency on both CPUs and GPUs. Our annotators provide a very competitive baseline for all the cases where annotations are not available.", "label": 0}

Such harmful or abusive content can have major negative impact on society, e.g., cyberbullying can lead to suicides, rumors about COVID-19 can cause vaccine hesitance, promotion of fake cures for COVID-19 can cause health harms and deaths. The content that is posted and shared online can be textual, visual, or a combination of both, e.g., in a meme.

QE aims to automatically predict the quality of machine translation (MT) output without reference sentences. Despite its high utility in the real world, there remain several limitations concerning manual QE data creation: inevitably incurred non-trivial costs due to the need for translation experts, and issues with data scaling and language expansion. To tackle these limitations, we present QUAK, a Korean-English synthetic QE dataset generated in a fully automatic manner. This consists of three sub-QUAK datasets QUAK-M, QUAK-P, and QUAK-H, produced through three strategies that are relatively free from language constraints. Since each strategy requires no human effort, which facilitates scalability, we scale our data up to 1.58M for QUAK-P, H and 6.58M for QUAK-M. As an experiment, we quantitatively analyze word-level QE results in various ways while performing statistical analysis. Moreover, we show that datasets scaled in an efficient way also contribute to performance improvements by observing meaningful performance gains in QUAK-M, P when adding data up to 1.58M.", "label": 0}

Frank, Mirjam Ernestus\nAbstract: Distributional semantic models capture word-level meaning that is useful in many natural language processing tasks and have even been shown to capture cognitive aspects of word meaning. The majority of these models are purely text based, even though the human sensory experience is much richer. In this paper we create visually grounded word embeddings by combining English text and images and compare them to popular text-based methods, to see if visual information allows our model to better capture cognitive aspects of word meaning. Our analysis shows that visually grounded embedding similarities are more predictive of the human reaction times in a large priming experiment than the purely text-based embeddings. The visually grounded embeddings also correlate well with human word similarity ratings. Importantly, in both experiments we show that the grounded embeddings account for a unique portion of explained variance, even when we include text-based embeddings trained on huge corpora. This shows that visual grounding allows our model to capture information that cannot be extracted using text as the only source of information.", "label": 0}

However, there is a gap between public benchmarks and real-world applications where noise such as typos or grammatical mistakes is abundant, resulting in degraded performance. Unfortunately, works that assess the robustness of neural models on noisy data and suggest improvements are limited to the English language. Upon analyzing noise in different languages, we observe that noise types vary across languages and thus require their own investigation. Thus, to benchmark the performance of pretrained multilingual models, we construct noisy datasets covering five languages and four NLP tasks. We see a gap in performance between clean and noisy data. After investigating ways to boost the zero-shot cross-lingual robustness of multilingual pretrained models, we propose Robust Contrastive Pretraining (RCP). RCP combines data augmentation with a contrastive loss term at the pretraining stage and achieves large improvements on noisy (& original test data) across two sentence-level classification (+3.2%) and two sequence-labeling (+10 F1-score) multilingual tasks.", "label": 0}

A lot of research has been devoted to devising and improving the way the knowledge base is accessed and incorporated into the model, resulting in a number of mechanisms and pipelines. Despite the diversity of proposed mechanisms, there are patterns in the designs of such systems. In this paper, we systematically describe the typology of artefacts (items retrieved from a knowledge base), retrieval mechanisms and the way these artefacts are fused into the model. This further allows us to uncover combinations of design decisions that had not yet been tried. Most of the focus is given to language models, though we also show how question answering, fact-checking and knowledgable dialogue models fit into this system as well. Having an abstract model which can describe the architecture of specific models also helps with transferring these architectures between multiple NLP tasks.", "label": 0}

We explored traditional linguistic features and neural network-based methods to develop a benchmark system for hate speech detection for the Bangla language. Our experimental results show that existing word embedding models trained with informal texts perform better than those trained with formal text.

{"text": "Title: Multilingual Mix: Example Interpolation Improves Multilingual Neural Machine Translation\nAuthors: Yong Cheng, Ankur Bapna, Orhan Firat, Yuan Cao, Pidong Wang, Wolfgang Macherey\nAbstract: Multilingual neural machine translation models are trained to maximize the likelihood of a mix of examples drawn from multiple language pairs. The dominant inductive bias applied to these models is a shared vocabulary and a shared set of parameters across languages; the inputs and labels corresponding to examples drawn from different language pairs might still reside in distinct sub-spaces. In this paper, we introduce multilingual crossover encoder-decoder (mXEncDec) to fuse language pairs at an instance level. Our approach interpolates instances from different language pairs into joint `crossover examples' in order to encourage sharing input and output spaces across languages. To ensure better fusion of examples in multilingual settings, we propose several techniques to improve example interpolation across dissimilar languages under heavy data imbalance. Experiments on a large-scale WMT multilingual dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly improves quality on English-to-Many, Many-to-English and zero-shot translation tasks (from +0.5 BLEU up to +5.5 BLEU points). Results on code-switching sets demonstrate the capability of our approach to improve model generalization to out-of-distribution multilingual examples. We also conduct qualitative and quantitative representation comparisons to analyze the advantages of our approach at the representation level.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: Procedural Text Understanding via Scene-Wise Evolution\nAuthors: Jialong Tang, Hongyu Lin, Meng Liao, Yaojie Lu, Xianpei Han, Le Sun, Weijian Xie, Jin Xu\nAbstract: Procedural text understanding requires machines to reason about entity states within the dynamical narratives. Current procedural text understanding approaches are commonly \\textbf{entity-wise}, which separately track each entity and independently predict different states of each entity. Such an entity-wise paradigm does not consider the interaction between entities and their states. In this paper, we propose a new \\textbf{scene-wise} paradigm for procedural text understanding, which jointly tracks states of all entities in a scene-by-scene manner. Based on this paradigm, we propose \\textbf{S}cene \\textbf{G}raph \\textbf{R}easoner (\\textbf{SGR}), which introduces a series of dynamically evolving scene graphs to jointly formulate the evolution of entities, states and their associations throughout the narrative. In this way, the deep interactions between all entities and states can be jointly captured and simultaneously derived from scene graphs. Experiments show that SGR not only achieves the new state-of-the-art performance but also significantly accelerates the speed of reasoning.", "label": 0}

However, there are no sizable datasets that contain offensive texts and their inoffensive counterparts, and fine-tuning pretrained models with limited labeled data can lead to the loss of original meaning in the style-transferred text. To address this issue, we provide two major contributions. First, we release the first publicly-available, parallel corpus of offensive Reddit comments and their style-transferred counterparts annotated by expert sociolinguists. Then, we introduce the first discourse-aware style-transfer models that can effectively reduce offensiveness in Reddit text while preserving the meaning of the original text. These models are the first to examine inferential links between the comment and the text it is replying to when transferring the style of offensive Reddit text. We propose two different methods of integrating discourse relations with pretrained transformer models and evaluate them on our dataset of offensive comments from Reddit and their inoffensive counterparts. Improvements over the baseline with respect to both automatic metrics and human evaluation indicate that our discourse-aware models are better at preserving meaning in style-transferred text when compared to the state-of-the-art discourse-agnostic models.", "label": 0}

As is common in social media data in this domain, the class labels of the corpus are very imbalanced.

With the development of pre-trained language models, many prompt-based approaches to data-efficient information extraction have been proposed and achieved impressive performance. However, existing prompt learning methods for information extraction are still susceptible to several potential limitations: (i) semantic gap between natural language and output structure knowledge with pre-defined schema; (ii) representation learning with locally individual instances limits the performance given the insufficient features. In this paper, we propose a novel approach of schema-aware Reference As Prompt (RAP), which dynamically leverage schema and knowledge inherited from global (few-shot) training data for each sample. Specifically, we propose a schema-aware reference store, which unifies symbolic schema and relevant textual instances. Then, we employ a dynamic reference integration module to retrieve pertinent knowledge from the datastore as prompts during training and inference. Experimental results demonstrate that RAP can be plugged into various existing models and outperforms baselines in low-resource settings on four datasets of relational triple extraction and event extraction. In addition, we provide comprehensive empirical ablations and case analysis regarding different types and scales of knowledge in order to better understand the mechanisms of RAP.

{"text": "Title: What Has Been Enhanced in my Knowledge-Enhanced Language Model?\nAuthors: Yifan Hou, Guoji Fu, Mrinmaya Sachan\nAbstract: Pretrained language models (LMs) do not capture factual knowledge very well. This has led to the development of a number of knowledge integration (KI) methods which aim to incorporate external knowledge into pretrained LMs. Even though KI methods show some performance gains over vanilla LMs, the inner-workings of these methods are not well-understood. For instance, it is unclear how and what kind of knowledge is effectively integrated into these models and if such integration may lead to catastrophic forgetting of already learned knowledge. This paper revisits the KI process in these models with an information-theoretic view and shows that KI can be interpreted using a graph convolution operation. We propose a probe model called \\textit{Graph Convolution Simulator} (GCS) for interpreting knowledge-enhanced LMs and exposing what kind of knowledge is integrated into these models. We conduct experiments to verify that our GCS can indeed be used to correctly interpret the KI process, and we use it to analyze two well-known knowledge-enhanced LMs: ERNIE and K-Adapter, and find that only a small amount of factual knowledge is integrated in them. We stratify knowledge in terms of various relation types and find that ERNIE and K-Adapter integrate different kinds of knowledge to different extent. Our analysis also shows that simply increasing the size of the KI corpus may not lead to better KI; fundamental advances may be needed.", "label": 0}

A clear example is air traffic control (ATC) communications. ATC aims at guiding aircraft and controlling the airspace in a safe and optimal manner. These voice-based dialogues are carried between an air traffic controller (ATCO) and pilots via very-high frequency radio channels. In order to incorporate these novel technologies into ATC (low-resource domain), large-scale annotated datasets are required to develop the data-driven AI systems. Two examples are automatic speech recognition (ASR) and natural language understanding (NLU). In this paper, we introduce the ATCO2 corpus, a dataset that aims at fostering research on the challenging ATC field, which has lagged behind due to lack of annotated data. The ATCO2 corpus covers 1) data collection and pre-processing, 2) pseudo-annotations of speech data, and 3) extraction of ATC-related named entities. The ATCO2 corpus is split into three subsets. 1) ATCO2-test-set corpus contains 4 hours of ATC speech with manual transcripts and a subset with gold annotations for named-entity recognition (callsign, command, value). 2) The ATCO2-PL-set corpus consists of 5281 hours of unlabeled ATC data enriched with automatic transcripts from an in-domain speech recognizer, contextual information, speaker turn information, signal-to-noise ratio estimate and English language detection score per sample. Both available for purchase through ELDA at http://catalog.elra.info/en-us/repository/browse/ELRA-S0484. 3) The ATCO2-test-set-1h corpus is a one-hour subset from the original test set corpus, that we are offering for free at https://www.atco2.org/data. We expect the ATCO2 corpus will foster research on robust ASR and NLU not only in the field of ATC communications but also in the general research community.", "label": 0}

We made a key assumption that if an encoder embedding frame is classified as a blank frame by the CTC model, it is likely that this frame will be aligned to blank for all the partial alignments or hypotheses in RNN-T and it can be discarded from the decoder input. We also show that this frame reduction operation can be applied in the middle of the encoder, which result in significant speed up for the training and inference in RNN-T. We further show that the CTC alignment, a by-product of the CTC decoder, can also be used to perform lattice reduction for RNN-T during training. Our method is evaluated on the Librispeech and SpeechStew tasks. We demonstrate that the proposed method is able to accelerate the RNN-T inference by 2.2 times with similar or slightly better word error rates (WER).", "label": 0}

In contrast to traditional rule-based skill routing, state-of-the-art systems use a model-based approach to enable natural conversations. To provide supervision signal required to train such models, ideas such as human annotation, replication of a rule-based system, relabeling based on user paraphrases, and bandit-based learning were suggested. However, these approaches: (a) do not scale in terms of the number of skills and skill on-boarding, (b) require a very costly expert annotation/rule-design, (c) introduce risks in the user experience with each model update. In this paper, we present a scalable self-learning approach to explore routing alternatives without causing abrupt policy changes that break the user experience, learn from the user interaction, and incrementally improve the routing via frequent model refreshes. To enable such robust frequent model updates, we suggest a simple and effective approach that ensures controlled policy updates for individual domains, followed by an off-policy evaluation for making deployment decisions without any need for lengthy A/B experimentation. We conduct various offline and online A/B experiments on a commercial large-scale conversational system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in real-world production settings.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Robust Domain Adaptation for Machine Reading Comprehension\nAuthors: Liang Jiang, Zhenyu Huang, Jia Liu, Zujie Wen, Xi Peng\nAbstract: Most domain adaptation methods for machine reading comprehension (MRC) use a pre-trained question-answer (QA) construction model to generate pseudo QA pairs for MRC transfer. Such a process will inevitably introduce mismatched pairs (i.e., noisy correspondence) due to i) the unavailable QA pairs in target documents, and ii) the domain shift during applying the QA construction model to the target domain. Undoubtedly, the noisy correspondence will degenerate the performance of MRC, which however is neglected by existing works. To solve such an untouched problem, we propose to construct QA pairs by additionally using the dialogue related to the documents, as well as a new domain adaptation method for MRC. Specifically, we propose Robust Domain Adaptation for Machine Reading Comprehension (RMRC) method which consists of an answer extractor (AE), a question selector (QS), and an MRC model. Specifically, RMRC filters out the irrelevant answers by estimating the correlation to the document via the AE, and extracts the questions by fusing the candidate questions in multiple rounds of dialogue chats via the QS. With the extracted QA pairs, MRC is fine-tuned and provides the feedback to optimize the QS through a novel reinforced self-training method. Thanks to the optimization of the QS, our method will greatly alleviate the noisy correspondence problem caused by the domain shift. To the best of our knowledge, this could be the first study to reveal the influence of noisy correspondence in domain adaptation MRC models and show a feasible way to achieve robustness to mismatched pairs. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.", "label": 0}

Important fields like education and politics, which often lay a foundation for the future of equality in society, need scrutiny to design policies that can better foster equality in resource distribution constrained by the unbalanced demographic distribution of people in the country.   We collect three publicly available datasets to train state-of-the-art classifiers in the domain of gender and caste classification. We train the models in the Indian context, where the same name can have different styling conventions (Jolly Abraham/Kumar Abhishikta in one state may be written as Abraham Jolly/Abishikta Kumar in the other). Finally, we also perform cross-testing (training and testing on different datasets) to understand the efficacy of the above models.   We also perform an error analysis of the prediction models. Finally, we attempt to assess the bias in the existing Indian system as case studies and find some intriguing patterns manifesting in the complex demographic layout of the sub-continent across the dimensions of gender and caste.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: Consistent Representation Learning for Continual Relation Extraction\nAuthors: Kang Zhao, Hua Xu, Jiangong Yang, Kai Gao\nAbstract: Continual relation extraction (CRE) aims to continuously train a model on data with new relations while avoiding forgetting old ones. Some previous work has proved that storing a few typical samples of old relations and replaying them when learning new relations can effectively avoid forgetting. However, these memory-based methods tend to overfit the memory samples and perform poorly on imbalanced datasets. To solve these challenges, a consistent representation learning method is proposed, which maintains the stability of the relation embedding by adopting contrastive learning and knowledge distillation when replaying memory. Specifically, supervised contrastive learning based on a memory bank is first used to train each new task so that the model can effectively learn the relation representation. Then, contrastive replay is conducted of the samples in memory and makes the model retain the knowledge of historical relations through memory knowledge distillation to prevent the catastrophic forgetting of the old task.

{"text": "Title: BARCOR: Towards A Unified Framework for Conversational Recommendation Systems\nAuthors: Ting-Chun Wang, Shang-Yu Su, Yun-Nung Chen\nAbstract: Recommendation systems focus on helping users find items of interest in the situations of information overload, where users' preferences are typically estimated by the past observed behaviors. In contrast, conversational recommendation systems (CRS) aim to understand users' preferences via interactions in conversation flows. CRS is a complex problem that consists of two main tasks: (1) recommendation and (2) response generation. Previous work often tried to solve the problem in a modular manner, where recommenders and response generators are separate neural models. Such modular architectures often come with a complicated and unintuitive connection between the modules, leading to inefficient learning and other issues. In this work, we propose a unified framework based on BART for conversational recommendation, which tackles two tasks in a single model. Furthermore, we also design and collect a lightweight knowledge graph for CRS in the movie domain. The experimental results show that the proposed methods achieve the state-of-the-art performance in terms of both automatic and human evaluation.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Improving word mover's distance by leveraging self-attention matrix\nAuthors: Hiroaki Yamagiwa, Sho Yokoi, Hidetoshi Shimodaira\nAbstract: Measuring the semantic similarity between two sentences is still an important task. The word mover's distance (WMD) computes the similarity via the optimal alignment between the sets of word embeddings. However, WMD does not utilize word order, making it difficult to distinguish sentences with large overlaps of similar words, even if they are semantically very different. Here, we attempt to improve WMD by incorporating the sentence structure represented by BERT's self-attention matrix (SAM). The proposed method is based on the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance, which simultaneously considers the similarity of the word embedding and the SAM for calculating the optimal transport between two sentences. Experiments on paraphrase identification and semantic textual similarity show that the proposed method improves WMD and its variants.

Recent studies achieved promising results by using pre-trained models in low-resource scenarios. Inspired by this, we aim to ask: which (if any) pre-training strategies can improve performance across SLU benchmarks? To answer this question, we employ four types of pre-trained models and their combinations for SLU. We leverage self-supervised speech and language models (LM) pre-trained on large quantities of unpaired data to extract strong speech and text representations. We also explore using supervised models pre-trained on larger external automatic speech recognition (ASR) or SLU corpora. We conduct extensive experiments on the SLU Evaluation (SLUE) benchmark and observe self-supervised pre-trained models to be more powerful, with pre-trained LM and speech models being most beneficial for the Sentiment Analysis and Named Entity Recognition task, respectively.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Probing Spurious Correlations in Popular Event-Based Rumor Detection Benchmarks\nAuthors: Jiaying Wu, Bryan Hooi\nAbstract: As social media becomes a hotbed for the spread of misinformation, the crucial task of rumor detection has witnessed promising advances fostered by open-source benchmark datasets. Despite being widely used, we find that these datasets suffer from spurious correlations, which are ignored by existing studies and lead to severe overestimation of existing rumor detection performance. The spurious correlations stem from three causes: (1) event-based data collection and labeling schemes assign the same veracity label to multiple highly similar posts from the same underlying event; (2) merging multiple data sources spuriously relates source identities to veracity labels; and (3) labeling bias. In this paper, we closely investigate three of the most popular rumor detection benchmark datasets (i.e., Twitter15, Twitter16 and PHEME), and propose event-separated rumor detection as a solution to eliminate spurious cues. Under the event-separated setting, we observe that the accuracy of existing state-of-the-art models drops significantly by over 40%, becoming only comparable to a simple neural classifier. To better address this task, we propose Publisher Style Aggregation (PSA), a generalizable approach that aggregates publisher posting records to learn writing style and veracity stance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and generalizability.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: A Generative Language Model for Few-shot Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis\nAuthors: Ehsan Hosseini-Asl, Wenhao Liu, Caiming Xiong\nAbstract: Sentiment analysis is an important task in natural language processing. In recent works, pre-trained language models are often used to achieve state-of-the-art results, especially when training data is scarce. It is common to fine-tune on the downstream task, usually by adding task-specific layers on top of the model. In this paper, we focus on aspect-based sentiment analysis, which involves extracting aspect term, category, and predicting their corresponding polarities. In particular, we are interested in few-shot settings. We propose to reformulate the extraction and prediction tasks into the sequence generation task, using a generative language model with unidirectional attention (GPT2 is used unless stated otherwise). This way, the model learns to accomplish the tasks via language generation without the need of training task-specific layers. Our evaluation results on the single-task polarity prediction show that our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art (based on BERT) on average performance by a large margins in few-shot and full-shot settings. More importantly, our generative approach significantly reduces the model variance caused by low-resource data. We further demonstrate that the proposed generative language model can handle joint and multi-task settings, unlike previous work. We observe that the proposed sequence generation method achieves further improved performances on polarity prediction when the model is trained via joint and multi-task settings. Further evaluation on similar sentiment analysis datasets, SST-2, SST- and OOS intent detection validates the superiority and noise robustness of generative language model in few-shot settings.", "label": 0}

However, current structure-controlling methods have limited effectiveness in enforcing the desired structure. To address this limitation, we propose a sentence-level beam search generation method (SentBS), where evaluation is conducted throughout the generation process to select suitable sentences for subsequent generations. We experiment with different combinations of decoding methods to be used as subcomponents by SentBS and evaluate results on the structure-controlled dataset MReD. Experiments show that all explored combinations for SentBS can improve the agreement between the generated text and the desired structure, with the best method significantly reducing the structural discrepancies suffered by the existing model, by approximately 68%.", "label": 0}

A large body of defense methods has been proposed. However, they are still limited due to redundant attack search spaces and the inability to defend against various types of attacks. In this work, we present a novel fine-tuning approach called \\textbf{RO}bust \\textbf{SE}letive fine-tuning (\\textbf{ROSE}) to address this issue. ROSE conducts selective updates when adapting pre-trained models to downstream tasks, filtering out invaluable and unrobust updates of parameters. Specifically, we propose two strategies: the first-order and second-order ROSE for selecting target robust parameters. The experimental results show that ROSE achieves significant improvements in adversarial robustness on various downstream NLP tasks, and the ensemble method even surpasses both variants above. Furthermore, ROSE can be easily incorporated into existing fine-tuning methods to improve their adversarial robustness further. The empirical analysis confirms that ROSE eliminates unrobust spurious updates during fine-tuning, leading to solutions corresponding to flatter and wider optima than the conventional method.

Prior work have largely focused on generating diverse dialogue responses that exhibit persona consistency and empathy. However, when it comes to the contextual coherence of the generated responses, there is still room for improvement. Hence, to improve the contextual coherence, we propose a novel Uncertainty Aware CVAE (UA-CVAE) framework. The UA-CVAE framework involves approximating and incorporating the aleatoric uncertainty during response generation. We apply our framework to both personalized and empathetic dialogue generation. Empirical results show that our framework significantly improves the contextual coherence of the generated response. Additionally, we introduce a novel automatic metric for measuring contextual coherence, which was found to correlate positively with human judgement.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: A Multi-Document Coverage Reward for RELAXed Multi-Document Summarization\nAuthors: Jacob Parnell, Inigo Jauregi Unanue, Massimo Piccardi\nAbstract: Multi-document summarization (MDS) has made significant progress in recent years, in part facilitated by the availability of new, dedicated datasets and capacious language models. However, a standing limitation of these models is that they are trained against limited references and with plain maximum-likelihood objectives. As for many other generative tasks, reinforcement learning (RL) offers the potential to improve the training of MDS models; yet, it requires a carefully-designed reward that can ensure appropriate leverage of both the reference summaries and the input documents. For this reason, in this paper we propose fine-tuning an MDS baseline with a reward that balances a reference-based metric such as ROUGE with coverage of the input documents. To implement the approach, we utilize RELAX (Grathwohl et al., 2018), a contemporary gradient estimator which is both low-variance and unbiased, and we fine-tune the baseline in a few-shot style for both stability and computational efficiency. Experimental results over the Multi-News and WCEP MDS datasets show significant improvements of up to +0.95 pp average ROUGE score and +3.17 pp METEOR score over the baseline, and competitive results with the literature. In addition, they show that the coverage of the input documents is increased, and evenly across all documents.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Multimodal Neural Machine Translation with Search Engine Based Image Retrieval\nAuthors: ZhenHao Tang, XiaoBing Zhang, Zi Long, XiangHua Fu\nAbstract: Recently, numbers of works shows that the performance of neural machine translation (NMT) can be improved to a certain extent with using visual information. However, most of these conclusions are drawn from the analysis of experimental results based on a limited set of bilingual sentence-image pairs, such as Multi30K. In these kinds of datasets, the content of one bilingual parallel sentence pair must be well represented by a manually annotated image, which is different with the actual translation situation. Some previous works are proposed to addressed the problem by retrieving images from exiting sentence-image pairs with topic model. However, because of the limited collection of sentence-image pairs they used, their image retrieval method is difficult to deal with the out-of-vocabulary words, and can hardly prove that visual information enhance NMT rather than the co-occurrence of images and sentences. In this paper, we propose an open-vocabulary image retrieval methods to collect descriptive images for bilingual parallel corpus using image search engine. Next, we propose text-aware attentive visual encoder to filter incorrectly collected noise images. Experiment results on Multi30K and other two translation datasets show that our proposed method achieves significant improvements over strong baselines.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: ASR Error Detection via Audio-Transcript entailment\nAuthors: Nimshi Venkat Meripo, Sandeep Konam\nAbstract: Despite improved performances of the latest Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, transcription errors are still unavoidable. These errors can have a considerable impact in critical domains such as healthcare, when used to help with clinical documentation. Therefore, detecting ASR errors is a critical first step in preventing further error propagation to downstream applications. To this end, we propose a novel end-to-end approach for ASR error detection using audio-transcript entailment. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to frame this problem as an end-to-end entailment task between the audio segment and its corresponding transcript segment. Our intuition is that there should be a bidirectional entailment between audio and transcript when there is no recognition error and vice versa. The proposed model utilizes an acoustic encoder and a linguistic encoder to model the speech and transcript respectively. The encoded representations of both modalities are fused to predict the entailment. Since doctor-patient conversations are used in our experiments, a particular emphasis is placed on medical terms. Our proposed model achieves classification error rates (CER) of 26.2% on all transcription errors and 23% on medical errors specifically, leading to improvements upon a strong baseline by 12% and 15.4%, respectively.", "label": 0}

We show that LMs benefit from the summarized version of complicated questions. Our findings show that superfluous information often present in problem description such as human characters, background stories, and names (which are included to help humans in understanding a task) does not help models in understanding a task.

Our meta-dataset consists of human and synthesized summaries of the long and complicated programming questions. Experimental results on Codex show that our proposed approach outperforms baseline by 8.13% on the APPS dataset and 11.88% on the CodeContests dataset on average in terms of strict accuracy. Our analysis shows that summaries significantly improve performance for introductory (9.86%) and interview (11.48%) programming questions.

{"text": "Title: Improving Radiology Report Generation Systems by Removing Hallucinated References to Non-existent Priors\nAuthors: Vignav Ramesh, Nathan Andrew Chi, Pranav Rajpurkar\nAbstract: Current deep learning models trained to generate radiology reports from chest radiographs are capable of producing clinically accurate, clear, and actionable text that can advance patient care. However, such systems all succumb to the same problem: making hallucinated references to non-existent prior reports. Such hallucinations occur because these models are trained on datasets of real-world patient reports that inherently refer to priors. To this end, we propose two methods to remove references to priors in radiology reports: (1) a GPT-3-based few-shot approach to rewrite medical reports without references to priors; and (2) a BioBERT-based token classification approach to directly remove words referring to priors. We use the aforementioned approaches to modify MIMIC-CXR, a publicly available dataset of chest X-rays and their associated free-text radiology reports; we then retrain CXR-RePaiR, a radiology report generation system, on the adapted MIMIC-CXR dataset. We find that our re-trained model--which we call CXR-ReDonE--outperforms previous report generation methods on clinical metrics, achieving an average BERTScore of 0.2351 (2.57% absolute improvement). We expect our approach to be broadly valuable in enabling current radiology report generation systems to be more directly integrated into clinical pipelines.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: Textless Direct Speech-to-Speech Translation with Discrete Speech Representation\nAuthors: Xinjian Li, Ye Jia, Chung-Cheng Chiu\nAbstract: Research on speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) has progressed rapidly in recent years. Many end-to-end systems have been proposed and show advantages over conventional cascade systems, which are often composed of recognition, translation and synthesis sub-systems. However, most of the end-to-end systems still rely on intermediate textual supervision during training, which makes it infeasible to work for languages without written forms. In this work, we propose a novel model, Textless Translatotron, which is based on Translatotron 2, for training an end-to-end direct S2ST model without any textual supervision. Instead of jointly training with an auxiliary task predicting target phonemes as in Translatotron 2, the proposed model uses an auxiliary task predicting discrete speech representations which are obtained from learned or random speech quantizers. When a speech encoder pre-trained with unsupervised speech data is used for both models, the proposed model obtains translation quality nearly on-par with Translatotron 2 on the multilingual CVSS-C corpus as well as the bilingual Fisher Spanish-English corpus. On the latter, it outperforms the prior state-of-the-art textless model by +18.5 BLEU.", "label": 0}

Few work exploited extracting finer-grained Elementary Discourse Unit (EDU) and there is little analysis and justification for the extractive unit selection. To fill such a gap, this paper firstly conducts oracle analysis to compare the upper bound of performance for models based on EDUs and sentences. The analysis provides evidences from both theoretical and experimental perspectives to justify that EDUs make more concise and precise summary than sentences without losing salient information. Then, considering this merit of EDUs, this paper further proposes EDU-level extractive model with Varying summary Lengths (EDU-VL) and develops the corresponding learning algorithm. EDU-VL learns to encode and predict probabilities of EDUs in document, and encode EDU-level candidate summaries with different lengths based on various $k$ values and select the best candidate summary in an end-to-end training manner.

This development poses significant challenges for conflict mediation, as mediators struggle to make sense of conflict dynamics, such as the range of conflict parties and the evolution of their political positions, the distinction between relevant and less relevant actors in peace-making, or the identification of key conflict issues and their interdependence. International peace efforts appear ill-equipped to successfully address these challenges. While technology is already being experimented with and used in a range of conflict related fields, such as conflict predicting or information gathering, less attention has been given to how technology can contribute to conflict mediation. This case study contributes to emerging research on the use of state-of-the-art machine learning technologies and techniques in conflict mediation processes. Using dialogue transcripts from peace negotiations in Yemen, this study shows how machine-learning can effectively support mediating teams by providing them with tools for knowledge management, extraction and conflict analysis. Apart from illustrating the potential of machine learning tools in conflict mediation, the paper also emphasises the importance of interdisciplinary and participatory, co-creation methodology for the development of context-sensitive and targeted tools and to ensure meaningful and responsible implementation.", "label": 0}

In which out-of-distribution settings does each paradigm excel? We investigate this question on both single-image and multi-image visual question-answering through four types of generalization tests: a novel segment-combine test for multi-image queries, contrast set, compositional generalization, and cross-benchmark transfer. Vision-and-language end-to-end trained systems exhibit sizeable performance drops across all these tests. Neuro-symbolic methods suffer even more on cross-benchmark transfer from GQA to VQA, but they show smaller accuracy drops on the other generalization tests and their performance quickly improves by few-shot training.

With the capacity of pretrained models growing rapidly, how to perform parameter-efficient fine-tuning has become fairly important for quick transfer learning and deployment. In this paper, we design a novel unified parameter-efficient transfer learning framework that works effectively on both pure language and V&L tasks. In particular, we use a shared hypernetwork that takes trainable hyper-embeddings as input, and outputs weights for fine-tuning different small modules in a pretrained language model, such as tuning the parameters inserted into multi-head attention blocks (i.e., prefix-tuning) and feed-forward blocks (i.e., adapter-tuning). We define a set of embeddings (e.g., layer, block, task and visual embeddings) as the key components to calculate hyper-embeddings, which thus can support both pure language and V&L tasks. Our proposed framework adds fewer trainable parameters in multi-task learning while achieving superior performances and transfer ability compared to state-of-the-art methods. Empirical results on the GLUE benchmark and multiple V&L tasks confirm the effectiveness of our framework on both textual and visual modalities.", "label": 0}

Here we consider three recently proposed deep generative frameworks for protein design: (AR) the sequence-based autoregressive generative model, (GVP) the precise structure-based graph neural network, and Fold2Seq that leverages a fuzzy and scale-free representation of a three-dimensional fold, while enforcing structure-to-sequence (and vice versa) consistency. We benchmark these models on the task of computational design of antibody sequences, which demand designing sequences with high diversity for functional implication. The Fold2Seq framework outperforms the two other baselines in terms of diversity of the designed sequences, while maintaining the typical fold.", "label": 0}

Participants in the study were adult Turkish-German bilinguals living in Germany or Turkey at the time of recording in the first half of the 1990s. The data were manually tokenised and normalised, and all proper names (names of participants and places mentioned in the conversations) were replaced with pseudonyms. Token-level automatic language identification was performed, which made it possible to establish the proportions of words from each language. The corpus is roughly balanced between both languages. We also present quantitative information about the number of code-switches, and give examples of different types of code-switching found in the data. The resulting corpus has been made freely available to the research community.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Describing image focused in cognitive and visual details for visually impaired people: An approach to generating inclusive paragraphs\nAuthors: Daniel Louzada Fernandes, Marcos Henrique Fonseca Ribeiro, Fabio Ribeiro Cerqueira, Michel Melo Silva\nAbstract: Several services for people with visual disabilities have emerged recently due to achievements in Assistive Technologies and Artificial Intelligence areas. Despite the growth in assistive systems availability, there is a lack of services that support specific tasks, such as understanding the image context presented in online content, e.g., webinars. Image captioning techniques and their variants are limited as Assistive Technologies as they do not match the needs of visually impaired people when generating specific descriptions. We propose an approach for generating context of webinar images combining a dense captioning technique with a set of filters, to fit the captions in our domain, and a language model for the abstractive summary task. The results demonstrated that we can produce descriptions with higher interpretability and focused on the relevant information for that group of people by combining image analysis methods and neural language models.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: I Know What You Do Not Know: Knowledge Graph Embedding via Co-distillation Learning\nAuthors: Yang Liu, Zequn Sun, Guangyao Li, Wei Hu\nAbstract: Knowledge graph (KG) embedding seeks to learn vector representations for entities and relations. Conventional models reason over graph structures, but they suffer from the issues of graph incompleteness and long-tail entities. Recent studies have used pre-trained language models to learn embeddings based on the textual information of entities and relations, but they cannot take advantage of graph structures. In the paper, we show empirically that these two kinds of features are complementary for KG embedding. To this end, we propose CoLE, a Co-distillation Learning method for KG Embedding that exploits the complementarity of graph structures and text information. Its graph embedding model employs Transformer to reconstruct the representation of an entity from its neighborhood subgraph. Its text embedding model uses a pre-trained language model to generate entity representations from the soft prompts of their names, descriptions, and relational neighbors. To let the two model promote each other, we propose co-distillation learning that allows them to distill selective knowledge from each other's prediction logits. In our co-distillation learning, each model serves as both a teacher and a student. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the two models outperform their related baselines, and the ensemble method CoLE with co-distillation learning advances the state-of-the-art of KG embedding.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Sketching as a Tool for Understanding and Accelerating Self-attention for Long Sequences\nAuthors: Yifan Chen, Qi Zeng, Dilek Hakkani-Tur, Di Jin, Heng Ji, Yun Yang\nAbstract: Transformer-based models are not efficient in processing long sequences due to the quadratic space and time complexity of the self-attention modules. To address this limitation, Linformer and Informer are proposed to reduce the quadratic complexity to linear (modulo logarithmic factors) via low-dimensional projection and row selection respectively. These two models are intrinsically connected, and to understand their connection, we introduce a theoretical framework of matrix sketching. Based on the theoretical analysis, we propose Skeinformer to accelerate self-attention and further improve the accuracy of matrix approximation to self-attention with three carefully designed components: column sampling, adaptive row normalization and pilot sampling reutilization. Experiments on the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark demonstrate that our methods outperform alternatives with a consistently smaller time/space footprint.", "label": 0}

Our benchmarks cover four jurisdictions (European Council, USA, Switzerland, and China), five languages (English, German, French, Italian and Chinese) and fairness across five attributes (gender, age, region, language, and legal area). In our experiments, we evaluate pre-trained language models using several group-robust fine-tuning techniques and show that performance group disparities are vibrant in many cases, while none of these techniques guarantee fairness, nor consistently mitigate group disparities. Furthermore, we provide a quantitative and qualitative analysis of our results, highlighting open challenges in the development of robustness methods in legal NLP.", "label": 0}

Recent works have leveraged natural language descriptions of schema elements to enable such systems; however, descriptions only indirectly convey schema semantics. In this work, we propose Show, Don't Tell, which prompts seq2seq models with a labeled example dialogue to show the semantics of schema elements rather than tell the model through descriptions. While requiring similar effort from service developers as generating descriptions, we show that using short examples as schema representations with large language models results in state-of-the-art performance on two popular dialogue state tracking benchmarks designed to measure zero-shot generalization - the Schema-Guided Dialogue dataset and the MultiWOZ leave-one-out benchmark.", "label": 0}

As an initial foray in this direction we study simple baseline techniques and evaluations, such as prompting. We find that the benefits from modest interventions increase with model size, generalize to a variety of alignment evaluations, and do not compromise the performance of large models. Next we investigate scaling trends for several training objectives relevant to alignment, comparing imitation learning, binary discrimination, and ranked preference modeling. We find that ranked preference modeling performs much better than imitation learning, and often scales more favorably with model size. In contrast, binary discrimination typically performs and scales very similarly to imitation learning. Finally we study a `preference model pre-training' stage of training, with the goal of improving sample efficiency when finetuning on human preferences.", "label": 0}

The task not only includes the correction of grammatical errors, such as missing prepositions and mismatched subject-verb agreement, but also orthographic and semantic errors, such as misspellings and word choice errors respectively. The field has seen significant progress in the last decade, motivated in part by a series of five shared tasks, which drove the development of rule-based methods, statistical classifiers, statistical machine translation, and finally neural machine translation systems which represent the current dominant state of the art. In this survey paper, we condense the field into a single article and first outline some of the linguistic challenges of the task, introduce the most popular datasets that are available to researchers (for both English and other languages), and summarise the various methods and techniques that have been developed with a particular focus on artificial error generation. We next describe the many different approaches to evaluation as well as concerns surrounding metric reliability, especially in relation to subjective human judgements, before concluding with an overview of recent progress and suggestions for future work and remaining challenges. We hope that this survey will serve as comprehensive resource for researchers who are new to the field or who want to be kept apprised of recent developments.", "label": 0}

They suppose that if the value of PPL is smaller, the quality(i.e. fluency) of the text to be evaluated is better. However, we find that the PPL referee is unqualified and it cannot evaluate the generated text fairly for the following reasons: (i) The PPL of short text is larger than long text, which goes against common sense, (ii) The repeated text span could damage the performance of PPL, and (iii) The punctuation marks could affect the performance of PPL heavily. Experiments show that the PPL is unreliable for evaluating the quality of given text. Last, we discuss the key problems with evaluating text quality using language models.", "label": 0}

Its speed and accuracy can significantly impact the returns of trading strategies.With the development of deep learning and Transformer-based pre-trained models like BERT, the accuracy of FSA has been much improved, but these time-consuming big models will also slow down the computation. To boost the processing speed of the FSA system and ensure high precision, we first propose an efficient and lightweight BERT (ELBERT) along with a novel confidence-window-based (CWB) early exit mechanism. Based on ELBERT, an innovative method to accelerate text processing on the GPU platform is developed, solving the difficult problem of making the early exit mechanism work more effectively with a large input batch size. Afterward, a fast and high-accuracy FSA system is built. Experimental results show that the proposed CWB early exit mechanism achieves significantly higher accuracy than existing early exit methods on BERT under the same computation cost. Besides, our FSA system can boost the processing speed to over 1000 texts per second with sufficient accuracy by using this acceleration method, which is nearly twice as fast as the FastBERT. Hence, this system can enable modern trading systems to quickly and accurately process financial text data.", "label": 0}

The proposed method incorporates four self-supervised and supervised subtasks for cross modality learning. A self-supervised speech subtask leverages unlabelled speech data, and a (self-)supervised text to text subtask makes use of abundant text training data. Two auxiliary supervised speech tasks are included to unify speech and text modeling space. Our contribution lies in integrating linguistic information from the text corpus into the speech pre-training. Detailed analysis reveals learning interference among subtasks. Two pre-training configurations for speech translation and recognition, respectively, are presented to alleviate subtask interference. Our experiments show the proposed method can effectively fuse speech and text information into one model. It achieves between 1.7 and 2.3 BLEU improvement above the state of the art on the MuST-C speech translation dataset and comparable WERs to wav2vec 2.0 on the Librispeech speech recognition task.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: How Universal is Genre in Universal Dependencies?\nAuthors: Max M\u00fcller-Eberstein, Rob van der Goot, Barbara Plank\nAbstract: This work provides the first in-depth analysis of genre in Universal Dependencies (UD). In contrast to prior work on genre identification which uses small sets of well-defined labels in mono-/bilingual setups, UD contains 18 genres with varying degrees of specificity spread across 114 languages. As most treebanks are labeled with multiple genres while lacking annotations about which instances belong to which genre, we propose four methods for predicting instance-level genre using weak supervision from treebank metadata. The proposed methods recover instance-level genre better than competitive baselines as measured on a subset of UD with labeled instances and adhere better to the global expected distribution. Our analysis sheds light on prior work using UD genre metadata for treebank selection, finding that metadata alone are a noisy signal and must be disentangled within treebanks before it can be universally applied.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Modeling Long-term Dependencies and Short-term Correlations in Patient Journey Data with Temporal Attention Networks for Health Prediction\nAuthors: Yuxi Liu, Zhenhao Zhang, Antonio Jimeno Yepes, Flora D. Salim\nAbstract: Building models for health prediction based on Electronic Health Records (EHR) has become an active research area. EHR patient journey data consists of patient time-ordered clinical events/visits from patients. Most existing studies focus on modeling long-term dependencies between visits, without explicitly taking short-term correlations between consecutive visits into account, where irregular time intervals, incorporated as auxiliary information, are fed into health prediction models to capture latent progressive patterns of patient journeys. We present a novel deep neural network with four modules to take into account the contributions of various variables for health prediction: i) the Stacked Attention module strengthens the deep semantics in clinical events within each patient journey and generates visit embeddings, ii) the Short-Term Temporal Attention module models short-term correlations between consecutive visit embeddings while capturing the impact of time intervals within those visit embeddings, iii) the Long-Term Temporal Attention module models long-term dependencies between visit embeddings while capturing the impact of time intervals within those visit embeddings, iv) and finally, the Coupled Attention module adaptively aggregates the outputs of Short-Term Temporal Attention and Long-Term Temporal Attention modules to make health predictions. Experimental results on MIMIC-III demonstrate superior predictive accuracy of our model compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, as well as the interpretability and robustness of this approach. Furthermore, we found that modeling short-term correlations contributes to local priors generation, leading to improved predictive modeling of patient journeys.", "label": 0}

However, despite its importance, it remains a relatively unexplored field, mainly due to the lack of appropriate datasets. At the same time, existing datasets suffer from various issues, including class imbalance issues, which can significantly affect the performance of the model on rare classes, as it is demonstrated in this paper. To this end, we propose LARD, a method for generating complex and realistic artificial disfluencies with little effort. The proposed method can handle three of the most common types of disfluencies: repetitions, replacements and restarts. In addition, we release a new large-scale dataset with disfluencies that can be used on four different tasks: disfluency detection, classification, extraction and correction. Experimental results on the LARD dataset demonstrate that the data produced by the proposed method can be effectively used for detecting and removing disfluencies, while also addressing limitations of existing datasets.", "label": 0}

The changes on lifestyles due to the pandemic may cause psychosocial stressors for individuals, and have a potential to lead to mental health problems. To provide high quality mental health supports, healthcare organization need to identify the COVID-19 specific stressors, and notice the trends of prevalence of those stressors. This study aims to apply natural language processing (NLP) on social media data to identify the psychosocial stressors during COVID-19 pandemic, and to analyze the trend on prevalence of stressors at different stages of the pandemic. We obtained dataset of 9266 Reddit posts from subreddit \\rCOVID19_support, from 14th Feb ,2020 to 19th July 2021. We used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model and lexicon methods to identify the topics that were mentioned on the subreddit. Our result presented a dashboard to visualize the trend of prevalence of topics about covid-19 related stressors being discussed on social media platform. The result could provide insights about the prevalence of pandemic related stressors during different stages of COVID-19.

For GPT-2, our learned policies demonstrate strong abilities of generalizing to unseen tasks in training, with a $5.8\\%$ improvement on average. Examples selected from our learned policies can even achieve a small improvement on GPT-3 Ada.

We describe key features of PPCEME that make it challenging for parsing, including a larger and more varied set of function tags than in the Penn Treebank. We present results for this corpus using a modified version of the Berkeley Neural Parser and the approach to function tag recovery of Gabbard et al (2006). Despite its simplicity, this approach works surprisingly well, suggesting it is possible to recover the original structure with sufficient accuracy to support linguistic applications (e.g., searching for syntactic structures of interest). However, for a subset of function tags (e.g., the tag indicating direct speech), additional work is needed, and we discuss some further limits of this approach.

However, the documentation intended to convey the model's details and appropriate use is tailored primarily to individuals with ML or NLP expertise. To address this gap, we conduct a design inquiry into interactive model cards, which augment traditionally static model cards with affordances for exploring model documentation and interacting with the models themselves. Our investigation consists of an initial conceptual study with experts in ML, NLP, and AI Ethics, followed by a separate evaluative study with non-expert analysts who use ML models in their work. Using a semi-structured interview format coupled with a think-aloud protocol, we collected feedback from a total of 30 participants who engaged with different versions of standard and interactive model cards. Through a thematic analysis of the collected data, we identified several conceptual dimensions that summarize the strengths and limitations of standard and interactive model cards, including: stakeholders; design; guidance; understandability & interpretability; sensemaking & skepticism; and trust & safety. Our findings demonstrate the importance of carefully considered design and interactivity for orienting and supporting non-expert analysts using deep learning models, along with a need for consideration of broader sociotechnical contexts and organizational dynamics. We have also identified design elements, such as language, visual cues, and warnings, among others, that support interactivity and make non-interactive content accessible. We summarize our findings as design guidelines and discuss their implications for a human-centered approach towards AI/ML documentation.", "label": 0}

However, they have recently been shown to suffer limitation in compositional generalization, failing to effectively learn the translation of atoms (e.g., words) and their semantic composition (e.g., modification) from seen compounds (e.g., phrases), and thus suffering from significantly weakened translation performance on unseen compounds during inference. We address this issue by introducing categorization to the source contextualized representations. The main idea is to enhance generalization by reducing sparsity and overfitting, which is achieved by finding prototypes of token representations over the training set and integrating their embeddings into the source encoding. Experiments on a dedicated MT dataset (i.e., CoGnition) show that our method reduces compositional generalization error rates by 24\\% error reduction. In addition, our conceptually simple method gives consistently better results than the Transformer baseline on a range of general MT datasets.", "label": 0}

It combines computer text classification and natural language processing to analyse text in aggregate. This method provides a descriptive categorization of the text, with features like content type, object field, lexical characteristics, and style traits. In this research, the authors aim to use natural language feature extraction methods in machine learning which are then used to train some of the basic machine learning models like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine.

While prior work has shown that a number of factors (e.g., information status, dependency length, and syntactic surprisal) influence Hindi word order preferences, the role of discourse predictability is underexplored in the literature. Inspired by prior work on syntactic priming, we investigate how the words and syntactic structures in a sentence influence the word order of the following sentences. Specifically, we extract sentences from the Hindi-Urdu Treebank corpus (HUTB), permute the preverbal constituents of those sentences, and build a classifier to predict which sentences actually occurred in the corpus against artificially generated distractors. The classifier uses a number of discourse-based features and cognitive features to make its predictions, including dependency length, surprisal, and information status. We find that information status and LSTM-based discourse predictability influence word order choices, especially for non-canonical object-fronted orders. We conclude by situating our results within the broader syntactic priming literature.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: RNN Transducers for Nested Named Entity Recognition with constraints on alignment for long sequences\nAuthors: Hagen Soltau, Izhak Shafran, Mingqiu Wang, Laurent El Shafey\nAbstract: Popular solutions to Named Entity Recognition (NER) include conditional random fields, sequence-to-sequence models, or utilizing the question-answering framework. However, they are not suitable for nested and overlapping spans with large ontologies and for predicting the position of the entities. To fill this gap, we introduce a new model for NER task -- an RNN transducer (RNN-T). These models are trained using paired input and output sequences without explicitly specifying the alignment between them, similar to other seq-to-seq models. RNN-T models learn the alignment using a loss function that sums over all alignments. In NER tasks, however, the alignment between words and target labels are available from the human annotations. We propose a fixed alignment RNN-T model that utilizes the given alignment, while preserving the benefits of RNN-Ts such as modeling output dependencies. As a more general case, we also propose a constrained alignment model where users can specify a relaxation of the given input alignment and the model will learn an alignment within the given constraints. In other words, we propose a family of seq-to-seq models which can leverage alignments between input and target sequences when available.

To address this, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques were introduced where small trainable components are injected in the PLM and updated during fine-tuning. We propose AdaMix as a general PEFT method that tunes a mixture of adaptation modules -- given the underlying PEFT method of choice -- introduced in each Transformer layer while keeping most of the PLM weights frozen. For instance, AdaMix can leverage a mixture of adapters like Houlsby or a mixture of low rank decomposition matrices like LoRA to improve downstream task performance over the corresponding PEFT methods for fully supervised and few-shot NLU and NLG tasks. Further, we design AdaMix such that it matches the same computational cost and the number of tunable parameters as the underlying PEFT method. By only tuning 0.1-0.2% of PLM parameters, we show that AdaMix outperforms SOTA parameter-efficient fine-tuning and full model fine-tuning for both NLU and NLG tasks.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Construction of Large-Scale Misinformation Labeled Datasets from Social Media Discourse using Label Refinement\nAuthors: Karishma Sharma, Emilio Ferrara, Yan Liu\nAbstract: Malicious accounts spreading misinformation has led to widespread false and misleading narratives in recent times, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, and social media platforms struggle to eliminate these contents rapidly. This is because adapting to new domains requires human intensive fact-checking that is slow and difficult to scale. To address this challenge, we propose to leverage news-source credibility labels as weak labels for social media posts and propose model-guided refinement of labels to construct large-scale, diverse misinformation labeled datasets in new domains. The weak labels can be inaccurate at the article or social media post level where the stance of the user does not align with the news source or article credibility. We propose a framework to use a detection model self-trained on the initial weak labels with uncertainty sampling based on entropy in predictions of the model to identify potentially inaccurate labels and correct for them using self-supervision or relabeling. The framework will incorporate social context of the post in terms of the community of its associated user for surfacing inaccurate labels towards building a large-scale dataset with minimum human effort. To provide labeled datasets with distinction of misleading narratives where information might be missing significant context or has inaccurate ancillary details, the proposed framework will use the few labeled samples as class prototypes to separate high confidence samples into false, unproven, mixture, mostly false, mostly true, true, and debunk information. The approach is demonstrated for providing a large-scale misinformation dataset on COVID-19 vaccines.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: Controlling Bias Exposure for Fair Interpretable Predictions\nAuthors: Zexue He, Yu Wang, Julian McAuley, Bodhisattwa Prasad Majumder\nAbstract: Recent work on reducing bias in NLP models usually focuses on protecting or isolating information related to a sensitive attribute (like gender or race). However, when sensitive information is semantically entangled with the task information of the input, e.g., gender information is predictive for a profession, a fair trade-off between task performance and bias mitigation is difficult to achieve. Existing approaches perform this trade-off by eliminating bias information from the latent space, lacking control over how much bias is necessarily required to be removed. We argue that a favorable debiasing method should use sensitive information 'fairly', rather than blindly eliminating it (Caliskan et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2019; Bogen et al., 2020). In this work, we provide a novel debiasing algorithm by adjusting the predictive model's belief to (1) ignore the sensitive information if it is not useful for the task; (2) use sensitive information minimally as necessary for the prediction (while also incurring a penalty). Experimental results on two text classification tasks (influenced by gender) and an open-ended generation task (influenced by race) indicate that our model achieves a desirable trade-off between debiasing and task performance along with producing debiased rationales as evidence.", "label": 0}

Nevertheless, if inexperienced developers fail to describe their problems clearly, it is hard for them to attract sufficient attention and get the anticipated answers. We propose M$_3$NSCT5, a novel approach to automatically generate multiple post titles from the given code snippets. Developers may use the generated titles to find closely related posts and complete their problem descriptions. M$_3$NSCT5 employs the CodeT5 backbone, which is a pre-trained Transformer model having an excellent language understanding and generation ability. To alleviate the ambiguity issue that the same code snippets could be aligned with different titles under varying contexts, we propose the maximal marginal multiple nucleus sampling strategy to generate multiple high-quality and diverse title candidates at a time for the developers to choose from. We build a large-scale dataset with 890,000 question posts covering eight programming languages to validate the effectiveness of M$_3$NSCT5. The automatic evaluation results on the BLEU and ROUGE metrics demonstrate the superiority of M$_3$NSCT5 over six state-of-the-art baseline models. Moreover, a human evaluation with trustworthy results also demonstrates the great potential of our approach for real-world application.", "label": 0}

Rule-based methods without considering context can not eliminate ambiguation, whereas sequence-to-sequence neural network based methods suffer from the unexpected and uninterpretable errors problem. Recently proposed hybrid system treats rule-based model and neural model as two cascaded sub-modules, where limited interaction capability makes neural network model cannot fully utilize expert knowledge contained in the rules. Inspired by Flat-LAttice Transformer (FLAT), we propose an end-to-end Chinese text normalization model, which accepts Chinese characters as direct input and integrates expert knowledge contained in rules into the neural network, both contribute to the superior performance of proposed model for the text normalization task. We also release a first publicly accessible largescale dataset for Chinese text normalization. Our proposed model has achieved excellent results on this dataset.", "label": 0}

Given this success, the adoption of discriminative criteria is promising to boost the performance of end-to-end (E2E) ASR systems. With this motivation, previous works have introduced the minimum Bayesian risk (MBR, one of the discriminative criteria) into E2E ASR systems. However, the effectiveness and efficiency of the MBR-based methods are compromised: the MBR criterion is only used in system training, which creates a mismatch between training and decoding; the on-the-fly decoding process in MBR-based methods results in the need for pre-trained models and slow training speeds. To this end, novel algorithms are proposed in this work to integrate another widely used discriminative criterion, lattice-free maximum mutual information (LF-MMI), into E2E ASR systems not only in the training stage but also in the decoding process. The proposed LF-MMI training and decoding methods show their effectiveness on two widely used E2E frameworks: Attention-Based Encoder-Decoders (AEDs) and Neural Transducers (NTs). Compared with MBR-based methods, the proposed LF-MMI method: maintains the consistency between training and decoding; eschews the on-the-fly decoding process; trains from randomly initialized models with superior training efficiency. Experiments suggest that the LF-MMI method outperforms its MBR counterparts and consistently leads to statistically significant performance improvements on various frameworks and datasets from 30 hours to 14.3k hours. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on Aishell-1 (CER 4.10%) and Aishell-2 (CER 5.02%) datasets. Code is released.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: A Label Dependence-aware Sequence Generation Model for Multi-level Implicit Discourse Relation Recognition\nAuthors: Changxing Wu, Liuwen Cao, Yubin Ge, Yang Liu, Min Zhang, Jinsong Su\nAbstract: Implicit discourse relation recognition (IDRR) is a challenging but crucial task in discourse analysis. Most existing methods train multiple models to predict multi-level labels independently, while ignoring the dependence between hierarchically structured labels. In this paper, we consider multi-level IDRR as a conditional label sequence generation task and propose a Label Dependence-aware Sequence Generation Model (LDSGM) for it. Specifically, we first design a label attentive encoder to learn the global representation of an input instance and its level-specific contexts, where the label dependence is integrated to obtain better label embeddings. Then, we employ a label sequence decoder to output the predicted labels in a top-down manner, where the predicted higher-level labels are directly used to guide the label prediction at the current level. We further develop a mutual learning enhanced training method to exploit the label dependence in a bottomup direction, which is captured by an auxiliary decoder introduced during training. Experimental results on the PDTB dataset show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on multi-level IDRR. We will release our code at https://github.com/nlpersECJTU/LDSGM.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Beyond Distributional Hypothesis: Let Language Models Learn Meaning-Text Correspondence\nAuthors: Myeongjun Jang, Frank Mtumbuka, Thomas Lukasiewicz\nAbstract: The logical negation property (LNP), which implies generating different predictions for semantically opposite inputs, is an important property that a trustworthy language model must satisfy. However, much recent evidence shows that large-size pre-trained language models (PLMs) do not satisfy this property. In this paper, we perform experiments using probing tasks to assess PLM's LNP understanding. Unlike previous studies that only examined negation expressions, we expand the boundary of the investigation to lexical semantics. Through experiments, we observe that PLMs violate the LNP frequently. To alleviate the issue, we propose a novel intermediate training task, names meaning-matching, designed to directly learn a meaning-text correspondence, instead of relying on the distributional hypothesis. Through multiple experiments, we find that the task enables PLMs to learn lexical semantic information. Also, through fine-tuning experiments on 7 GLUE tasks, we confirm that it is a safe intermediate task that guarantees a similar or better performance of downstream tasks. Finally, we observe that our proposed approach outperforms our previous counterparts despite its time and resource efficiency.", "label": 0}

Generalizing results for higher dimensional group and linear CA, we also establish the decidability results of the above dynamical properties as well as the injectivity for arbitrary NUCA with finite memory which are local perturbations of higher dimensional linear and group CA.

Existing conversational QA benchmarks compare models with pre-collected human-human conversations, using ground-truth answers provided in conversational history. It remains unclear whether we can rely on this static evaluation for model development and whether current systems can well generalize to real-world human-machine conversations. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale human evaluation of state-of-the-art conversational QA systems, where human evaluators converse with models and judge the correctness of their answers. We find that the distribution of human machine conversations differs drastically from that of human-human conversations, and there is a disagreement between human and gold-history evaluation in terms of model ranking. We further investigate how to improve automatic evaluations, and propose a question rewriting mechanism based on predicted history, which better correlates with human judgments. Finally, we analyze the impact of various modeling strategies and discuss future directions towards building better conversational question answering systems.", "label": 0}

Martin\nAbstract: Runtime verification (RV) has the potential to enable the safe operation of safety-critical systems that are too complex to formally verify, such as Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) applications. Writing correct monitors can itself be complex, and errors in the monitoring subsystem threaten the mission as a whole. This paper provides an overview of a formal approach to generating runtime monitors for autonomous robots from requirements written in a structured natural language. Our approach integrates the Formal Requirement Elicitation Tool (FRET) with Copilot, a runtime verification framework, through the Ogma integration tool. FRET is used to specify requirements with unambiguous semantics, which are then automatically translated into temporal logic formulae. Ogma generates monitor specifications from the FRET output, which are compiled into hard-real time C99. To facilitate integration of the monitors in ROS2, we have extended Ogma to generate ROS2 packages defining monitoring nodes, which run the monitors when new data becomes available, and publish the results of any violations. The goal of our approach is to treat the generated ROS2 packages as black boxes and integrate them into larger ROS2 systems with minimal effort.", "label": 0}

N Anigbogu\nAbstract: The spread of hatred that was formerly limited to verbal communications has rapidly moved over the Internet. Social media and community forums that allow people to discuss and express their opinions are becoming platforms for the spreading of hate messages. Many countries have developed laws to avoid online hate speech. They hold the companies that run the social media responsible for their failure to eliminate hate speech. But as online content continues to grow, so does the spread of hate speech However, manual analysis of hate speech on online platforms is infeasible due to the huge amount of data as it is expensive and time consuming. Thus, it is important to automatically process the online user contents to detect and remove hate speech from online media. Many recent approaches suffer from interpretability problem which means that it can be difficult to understand why the systems make the decisions they do. Through this work, some solutions for the problem of automatic detection of hate messages were proposed using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Na\\\"ive Bayes algorithms. This achieved near state-of-the-art performance while being simpler and producing more easily interpretable decisions than other methods. Empirical evaluation of this technique has resulted in a classification accuracy of approximately 99% and 50% for SVM and NB respectively over the test set.

However, it can spread fake or unreliable, low-quality news that intentionally contains false information. The spread of fake news can have a negative effect on people and society. Given the seriousness of such a problem, researchers did their best to identify patterns and characteristics that fake news may exhibit to design a system that can detect fake news before publishing. In this paper, we have described the Fake News Challenge stage #1 (FNC-1) dataset and given an overview of the competitive attempts to build a fake news detection system using the FNC-1 dataset. The proposed model was evaluated with the FNC-1 dataset. A competitive dataset is considered an open problem and a challenge worldwide. This system's procedure implies processing the text in the headline and body text columns with different natural language processing techniques. After that, the extracted features are reduced using the elbow truncated method, finding the similarity between each pair using the soft cosine similarity method. The new feature is entered into CNN and DNN deep learning approaches. The proposed system detects all the categories with high accuracy except the disagree category. As a result, the system achieves up to 84.6 % accuracy, classifying it as the second ranking based on other competitive studies regarding this dataset.", "label": 0}

In this study, we investigate how the pandemic has influenced people's emotions and psychological states compared to a pre-pandemic period using real-world data from social media.   Method: We collected Reddit social media data from 2019 (pre-pandemic) and 2020 (pandemic) from the subreddits communities associated with eight universities. We applied the pre-trained Robustly Optimized BERT pre-training approach (RoBERTa) to learn text embedding from the Reddit messages, and leveraged the relational information among posted messages to train a graph attention network (GAT) for sentiment classification. Finally, we applied model stacking to combine the prediction probabilities from RoBERTa and GAT to yield the final classification on sentiment. With the model-predicted sentiment labels on the collected data, we used a generalized linear mixed-effects model to estimate the effects of pandemic and in-person teaching during the pandemic on sentiment.   Results: The results suggest that the odds of negative sentiments in 2020 (pandemic) were 25.7% higher than the odds in 2019 (pre-pandemic) with a $p$-value $<0.001$; and the odds of negative sentiments associated in-person learning were 48.3% higher than with remote learning in 2020 with a $p$-value of 0.029.   Conclusions: Our study results are consistent with the findings in the literature on the negative impacts of the pandemic on people's emotions and psychological states. Our study contributes to the growing real-world evidence on the various negative impacts of the pandemic on our society; it also provides a good example of using both ML techniques and statistical modeling and inference to make better use of real-world data.", "label": 0}

CKE from text is known for suffering from the inherent sparsity and reporting bias of commonsense in text. Visual perception, on the other hand, contains rich commonsense knowledge about real-world entities, e.g., (person, can_hold, bottle), which can serve as promising sources for acquiring grounded commonsense knowledge. In this work, we present CLEVER, which formulates CKE as a distantly supervised multi-instance learning problem, where models learn to summarize commonsense relations from a bag of images about an entity pair without any human annotation on image instances. To address the problem, CLEVER leverages vision-language pre-training models for deep understanding of each image in the bag, and selects informative instances from the bag to summarize commonsense entity relations via a novel contrastive attention mechanism. Comprehensive experimental results in held-out and human evaluation show that CLEVER can extract commonsense knowledge in promising quality, outperforming pre-trained language model-based methods by 3.9 AUC and 6.4 mAUC points. The predicted commonsense scores show strong correlation with human judgment with a 0.78 Spearman coefficient. Moreover, the extracted commonsense can also be grounded into images with reasonable interpretability. The data and codes can be obtained at https://github.com/thunlp/CLEVER.", "label": 0}

In this work, we propose Multi-CLS BERT, a novel ensembling method for CLS-based prediction tasks that is almost as efficient as a single BERT model. Multi-CLS BERT uses multiple CLS tokens with a parameterization and objective that encourages their diversity. Thus instead of fine-tuning each BERT model in an ensemble (and running them all at test time), we need only fine-tune our single Multi-CLS BERT model (and run the one model at test time, ensembling just the multiple final CLS embeddings). To test its effectiveness, we build Multi-CLS BERT on top of a state-of-the-art pretraining method for BERT (Aroca-Ouellette and Rudzicz, 2020). In experiments on GLUE and SuperGLUE we show that our Multi-CLS BERT reliably improves both overall accuracy and confidence estimation. When only 100 training samples are available in GLUE, the Multi-CLS BERT_Base model can even outperform the corresponding BERT_Large model. We analyze the behavior of our Multi-CLS BERT, showing that it has many of the same characteristics and behavior as a typical BERT 5-way ensemble, but with nearly 4-times less computation and memory.", "label": 0}

Aided with a simple but dramatic data augmentation technique, our method converts text into annotated forms with minimum information loss. Sign languages are composed of manual signals, non-manual signals, and iconic features. According to professional sign language interpreters, non-manual signals such as facial expressions and gestures play an important role in conveying exact meaning. By considering the linguistic features of sign language, our proposed framework is a first and unique attempt to build a multimodal sign language augmentation corpus (hereinafter referred to as the KoSLA corpus) containing both manual and non-manual modalities. The corpus we built demonstrates confident results in the hospital context, showing improved performance with augmented datasets. To overcome data scarcity, we resorted to data augmentation techniques such as synonym replacement to boost the efficiency of our translation model and available data, while maintaining grammatical and semantic structures of sign language. For the experimental support, we verify the effectiveness of data augmentation technique and usefulness of our corpus by performing a translation task between normal sentences and sign language annotations on two tokenizers. The result was convincing, proving that the BLEU scores with the KoSLA corpus were significant.", "label": 0}

It has defined the meaning of AI since the beginning. A lot has been accomplished in this area recently, with voice assistant products entering our daily lives and chat bot systems becoming commonplace in customer service. At first glance there seems to be no shortage of options for dialogue systems. However, the frequently deployed dialogue systems today seem to all struggle with a critical weakness - they are hard to build and harder to maintain. At the core of the struggle is the need to script every single turn of interactions between the bot and the human user. This makes the dialogue systems more difficult to maintain as the tasks become more complex and more tasks are added to the system. In this paper, we propose Converse, a flexible tree-based modular task-oriented dialogue system. Converse uses an and-or tree structure to represent tasks and offers powerful multi-task dialogue management. Converse supports task dependency and task switching, which are unique features compared to other open-source dialogue frameworks. At the same time, Converse aims to make the bot building process easy and simple, for both professional and non-professional software developers.

In this work, we leverage unpaired data to train a general sequence-to-sequence model. Unpaired speech and text are used in the form of data pairs by generating the corresponding missing parts in prior to model training. Inspired by the complementarity of speech-PseudoLabel pair and SynthesizedAudio-text pair in both acoustic features and linguistic features, we propose a complementary joint training~(CJT) method that trains a model alternatively with two data pairs. Furthermore, label masking for pseudo-labels and gradient restriction for synthesized audio are proposed to further cope with the deviations from real data, termed as CJT++. Experimental results show that compared to speech-only training, the proposed basic CJT achieves great performance improvements on clean/other test sets, and the CJT++ re-training yields further performance enhancements. It is also apparent that the proposed method outperforms the wav2vec2.0 model with the same model size and beam size, particularly in extreme low-resource cases.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Visually Grounded VQA by Lattice-based Retrieval\nAuthors: Daniel Reich, Felix Putze, Tanja Schultz\nAbstract: Visual Grounding (VG) in Visual Question Answering (VQA) systems describes how well a system manages to tie a question and its answer to relevant image regions. Systems with strong VG are considered intuitively interpretable and suggest an improved scene understanding. While VQA accuracy performances have seen impressive gains over the past few years, explicit improvements to VG performance and evaluation thereof have often taken a back seat on the road to overall accuracy improvements. A cause of this originates in the predominant choice of learning paradigm for VQA systems, which consists of training a discriminative classifier over a predetermined set of answer options.   In this work, we break with the dominant VQA modeling paradigm of classification and investigate VQA from the standpoint of an information retrieval task. As such, the developed system directly ties VG into its core search procedure. Our system operates over a weighted, directed, acyclic graph, a.k.a. \"lattice\", which is derived from the scene graph of a given image in conjunction with region-referring expressions extracted from the question.   We give a detailed analysis of our approach and discuss its distinctive properties and limitations. Our approach achieves the strongest VG performance among examined systems and exhibits exceptional generalization capabilities in a number of scenarios.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Bootstrapping NLP tools across low-resourced African languages: an overview and prospects\nAuthors: C. Maria Keet\nAbstract: Computing and Internet access are substantially growing markets in Southern Africa, which brings with it increasing demands for local content and tools in indigenous African languages. Since most of those languages are low-resourced, efforts have gone into the notion of bootstrapping tools for one African language from another. This paper provides an overview of these efforts for Niger-Congo B (`Bantu') languages. Bootstrapping grammars for geographically distant languages has been shown to still have positive outcomes for morphology and rules or grammar-based natural language generation. Bootstrapping with data-driven approaches to NLP tasks is difficult to use meaningfully regardless geographic proximity, which is largely due to lexical diversity due to both orthography and vocabulary. Cladistic approaches in comparative linguistics may inform bootstrapping strategies and similarity measures might serve as proxy for bootstrapping potential as well, with both fertile ground for further research.", "label": 0}

It shows impressive performance on downstream tasks by zero-shot knowledge transfer. To further enhance CLIP's adaption capability, existing methods proposed to fine-tune additional learnable modules, which significantly improves the few-shot performance but introduces extra training time and computational resources. In this paper, we propose a training-free adaption method for CLIP to conduct few-shot classification, termed as Tip-Adapter, which not only inherits the training-free advantage of zero-shot CLIP but also performs comparably to those training-required approaches. Tip-Adapter constructs the adapter via a key-value cache model from the few-shot training set, and updates the prior knowledge encoded in CLIP by feature retrieval. On top of that, the performance of Tip-Adapter can be further boosted to be state-of-the-art on ImageNet by fine-tuning the cache model for 10$\\times$ fewer epochs than existing methods, which is both effective and efficient. We conduct extensive experiments of few-shot classification on 11 datasets to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed methods.

Detecting ADR's as early as possible and sharing them with regulators, pharma companies, and healthcare providers can prevent morbidity and save many lives. While most ADR's are not reported via formal channels, they are often documented in a variety of unstructured conversations such as social media posts by patients, customer support call transcripts, or CRM notes of meetings between healthcare providers and pharma sales reps. In this paper, we propose a natural language processing (NLP) solution that detects ADR's in such unstructured free-text conversations, which improves on previous work in three ways. First, a new Named Entity Recognition (NER) model obtains new state-of-the-art accuracy for ADR and Drug entity extraction on the ADE, CADEC, and SMM4H benchmark datasets (91.75%, 78.76%, and 83.41% F1 scores respectively). Second, two new Relation Extraction (RE) models are introduced - one based on BioBERT while the other utilizing crafted features over a Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN) - are shown to perform on par with existing state-of-the-art models, and outperform them when trained with a supplementary clinician-annotated RE dataset. Third, a new text classification model, for deciding if a conversation includes an ADR, obtains new state-of-the-art accuracy on the CADEC dataset (86.69% F1 score). The complete solution is implemented as a unified NLP pipeline in a production-grade library built on top of Apache Spark, making it natively scalable and able to process millions of batch or streaming records on commodity clusters.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: BER: Balanced Error Rate For Speaker Diarization\nAuthors: Tao Liu, Kai Yu\nAbstract: DER is the primary metric to evaluate diarization performance while facing a dilemma: the errors in short utterances or segments tend to be overwhelmed by longer ones. Short segments, e.g., `yes' or `no,' still have semantic information. Besides, DER overlooks errors in less-talked speakers. Although JER balances speaker errors, it still suffers from the same dilemma. Considering all those aspects, duration error, segment error, and speaker-weighted error constituting a complete diarization evaluation, we propose a Balanced Error Rate (BER) to evaluate speaker diarization. First, we propose a segment-level error rate (SER) via connected sub-graphs and adaptive IoU threshold to get accurate segment matching. Second, to evaluate diarization in a unified way, we adopt a speaker-specific harmonic mean between duration and segment, followed by a speaker-weighted average. Third, we analyze our metric via the modularized system, EEND, and the multi-modal method on real datasets. SER and BER are publicly available at https://github.com/X-LANCE/BER.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Adversarial Training for Improving Model Robustness? Look at Both Prediction and Interpretation\nAuthors: Hanjie Chen, Yangfeng Ji\nAbstract: Neural language models show vulnerability to adversarial examples which are semantically similar to their original counterparts with a few words replaced by their synonyms. A common way to improve model robustness is adversarial training which follows two steps-collecting adversarial examples by attacking a target model, and fine-tuning the model on the augmented dataset with these adversarial examples. The objective of traditional adversarial training is to make a model produce the same correct predictions on an original/adversarial example pair. However, the consistency between model decision-makings on two similar texts is ignored. We argue that a robust model should behave consistently on original/adversarial example pairs, that is making the same predictions (what) based on the same reasons (how) which can be reflected by consistent interpretations. In this work, we propose a novel feature-level adversarial training method named FLAT. FLAT aims at improving model robustness in terms of both predictions and interpretations. FLAT incorporates variational word masks in neural networks to learn global word importance and play as a bottleneck teaching the model to make predictions based on important words. FLAT explicitly shoots at the vulnerability problem caused by the mismatch between model understandings on the replaced words and their synonyms in original/adversarial example pairs by regularizing the corresponding global word importance scores. Experiments show the effectiveness of FLAT in improving the robustness with respect to both predictions and interpretations of four neural network models (LSTM, CNN, BERT, and DeBERTa) to two adversarial attacks on four text classification tasks. The models trained via FLAT also show better robustness than baseline models on unforeseen adversarial examples across different attacks.", "label": 0}

General frameworks are becoming increasingly available to measure ML fairness gaps between groups. However, ML for health (ML4H) auditing principles call for a contextual, patient-centered approach to model assessment. Therefore, ML auditing tools must be (1) better aligned with ML4H auditing principles and (2) able to illuminate and characterize communities vulnerable to the most harm. To address this gap, we propose supplementing ML4H auditing frameworks with SLOGAN (patient Severity-based LOcal Group biAs detectioN), an automatic tool for capturing local biases in a clinical prediction task. SLOGAN adapts an existing tool, LOGAN (LOcal Group biAs detectioN), by contextualizing group bias detection in patient illness severity and past medical history. We investigate and compare SLOGAN's bias detection capabilities to LOGAN and other clustering techniques across patient subgroups in the MIMIC-III dataset. On average, SLOGAN identifies larger fairness disparities in over 75% of patient groups than LOGAN while maintaining clustering quality. Furthermore, in a diabetes case study, health disparity literature corroborates the characterizations of the most biased clusters identified by SLOGAN. Our results contribute to the broader discussion of how machine learning biases may perpetuate existing healthcare disparities.", "label": 0}

We create CrossSum by aligning identical articles written in different languages via cross-lingual retrieval from a multilingual summarization dataset. We propose a multi-stage data sampling algorithm to effectively train a cross-lingual summarization model capable of summarizing an article in any target language. We also propose LaSE, a new metric for automatically evaluating model-generated summaries and showing a strong correlation with ROUGE. Performance on ROUGE and LaSE indicate that pretrained models fine-tuned on CrossSum consistently outperform baseline models, even when the source and target language pairs are linguistically distant. To the best of our knowledge, CrossSum is the largest cross-lingual summarization dataset and the first-ever that does not rely solely on English as the pivot language.

{"text": "Title: MorphTE: Injecting Morphology in Tensorized Embeddings\nAuthors: Guobing Gan, Peng Zhang, Sunzhu Li, Xiuqing Lu, Benyou Wang\nAbstract: In the era of deep learning, word embeddings are essential when dealing with text tasks. However, storing and accessing these embeddings requires a large amount of space. This is not conducive to the deployment of these models on resource-limited devices. Combining the powerful compression capability of tensor products, we propose a word embedding compression method with morphological augmentation, Morphologically-enhanced Tensorized Embeddings (MorphTE). A word consists of one or more morphemes, the smallest units that bear meaning or have a grammatical function. MorphTE represents a word embedding as an entangled form of its morpheme vectors via the tensor product, which injects prior semantic and grammatical knowledge into the learning of embeddings. Furthermore, the dimensionality of the morpheme vector and the number of morphemes are much smaller than those of words, which greatly reduces the parameters of the word embeddings. We conduct experiments on tasks such as machine translation and question answering. Experimental results on four translation datasets of different languages show that MorphTE can compress word embedding parameters by about 20 times without performance loss and significantly outperforms related embedding compression methods.", "label": 0}

Ng, Thomas Hain\nAbstract: For speech emotion datasets, it has been difficult to acquire large quantities of reliable data and acted emotions may be over the top compared to less expressive emotions displayed in everyday life. Lately, larger datasets with natural emotions have been created. Instead of ignoring smaller, acted datasets, this study investigates whether information learnt from acted emotions is useful for detecting natural emotions. Cross-corpus research has mostly considered cross-lingual and even cross-age datasets, and difficulties arise from different methods of annotating emotions causing a drop in performance. To be consistent, four adult English datasets covering acted, elicited and natural emotions are considered. A state-of-the-art model is proposed to accurately investigate the degradation of performance. The system involves a bi-directional LSTM with an attention mechanism to classify emotions across datasets. Experiments study the effects of training models in a cross-corpus and multi-domain fashion and results show the transfer of information is not successful. Out-of-domain models, followed by adapting to the missing dataset, and domain adversarial training (DAT) are shown to be more suitable to generalising to emotions across datasets. This shows positive information transfer from acted datasets to those with more natural emotions and the benefits from training on different corpora.", "label": 0}

One major issue with remote meetings is that it is challenging for remote participants to interrupt and speak. We have recently developed the first speech interruption analysis model, which detects failed speech interruptions, shows very promising performance, and is being deployed in the cloud. To deliver this feature in a more cost-efficient and environment-friendly way, we reduced the model complexity and size to ship the WavLM_SI model in client devices. In this paper, we first describe how we successfully improved the True Positive Rate (TPR) at a 1% False Positive Rate (FPR) from 50.9% to 68.3% for the failed speech interruption detection model by training on a larger dataset and fine-tuning. We then shrank the model size from 222.7 MB to 9.3 MB with an acceptable loss in accuracy and reduced the complexity from 31.2 GMACS (Giga Multiply-Accumulate Operations per Second) to 4.3 GMACS. We also estimated the environmental impact of the complexity reduction, which can be used as a general guideline for large Transformer-based models, and thus make those models more accessible with less computation overhead.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: EgoTaskQA: Understanding Human Tasks in Egocentric Videos\nAuthors: Baoxiong Jia, Ting Lei, Song-Chun Zhu, Siyuan Huang\nAbstract: Understanding human tasks through video observations is an essential capability of intelligent agents. The challenges of such capability lie in the difficulty of generating a detailed understanding of situated actions, their effects on object states (i.e., state changes), and their causal dependencies. These challenges are further aggravated by the natural parallelism from multi-tasking and partial observations in multi-agent collaboration. Most prior works leverage action localization or future prediction as an indirect metric for evaluating such task understanding from videos. To make a direct evaluation, we introduce the EgoTaskQA benchmark that provides a single home for the crucial dimensions of task understanding through question-answering on real-world egocentric videos. We meticulously design questions that target the understanding of (1) action dependencies and effects, (2) intents and goals, and (3) agents' beliefs about others. These questions are divided into four types, including descriptive (what status?), predictive (what will?), explanatory (what caused?), and counterfactual (what if?) to provide diagnostic analyses on spatial, temporal, and causal understandings of goal-oriented tasks. We evaluate state-of-the-art video reasoning models on our benchmark and show their significant gaps between humans in understanding complex goal-oriented egocentric videos. We hope this effort will drive the vision community to move onward with goal-oriented video understanding and reasoning.", "label": 0}

The intrinsic complexity of handling tables often adds an extra burden to both model design and data annotation. In this paper, we aim to develop a simple table-based QA model with minimal annotation effort. Motivated by the fact that table-based QA requires both alignment between questions and tables and the ability to perform complicated reasoning over multiple table elements, we propose an omnivorous pretraining approach that consumes both natural and synthetic data to endow models with these respective abilities. Specifically, given freely available tables, we leverage retrieval to pair them with relevant natural sentences for mask-based pretraining, and synthesize NL questions by converting SQL sampled from tables for pretraining with a QA loss. We perform extensive experiments in both few-shot and full settings, and the results clearly demonstrate the superiority of our model OmniTab, with the best multitasking approach achieving an absolute gain of 16.2% and 2.7% in 128-shot and full settings respectively, also establishing a new state-of-the-art on WikiTableQuestions.

However, when applied to specific domains, these models encounter considerable difficulties. This is the case of Social Networks such as Twitter, an ever-changing stream of information written with informal and complex language, where each message requires careful evaluation to be understood even by humans given the important role that context plays. Addressing tasks in this domain through Natural Language Processing involves severe challenges. When powerful state-of-the-art multilingual language models are applied to this scenario, language specific nuances use to get lost in translation. To face these challenges we present \\textbf{BERTuit}, the larger transformer proposed so far for Spanish language, pre-trained on a massive dataset of 230M Spanish tweets using RoBERTa optimization. Our motivation is to provide a powerful resource to better understand Spanish Twitter and to be used on applications focused on this social network, with special emphasis on solutions devoted to tackle the spreading of misinformation in this platform. BERTuit is evaluated on several tasks and compared against M-BERT, XLM-RoBERTa and XLM-T, very competitive multilingual transformers. The utility of our approach is shown with applications, in this case: a zero-shot methodology to visualize groups of hoaxes and profiling authors spreading disinformation.

A potential source of structured commonsense knowledge that could be used to derive insights is ConceptNet. In particular, ConceptNet contains several coarse-grained relations, including HasContext, FormOf and SymbolOf, which can prove invaluable in understanding broad, but critically important, commonsense notions such as 'context'. In this article, we present a methodology based on unsupervised knowledge graph representation learning and clustering to reveal and study substructures in three heavily used commonsense relations in ConceptNet. Our results show that, despite having an 'official' definition in ConceptNet, many of these commonsense relations exhibit considerable sub-structure. In the future, therefore, such relations could be sub-divided into other relations with more refined definitions.

Existing chatbots are usually trained from pre-collected and manually-labeled data and/or written with handcrafted rules. Many also use manually-compiled knowledge bases (KBs). Their ability to understand natural language is still limited, and they tend to produce many errors resulting in poor user satisfaction. Typically, they need to be constantly improved by engineers with more labeled data and more manually compiled knowledge. This book introduces the new paradigm of lifelong learning dialogue systems to endow chatbots the ability to learn continually by themselves through their own self-initiated interactions with their users and working environments to improve themselves. As the systems chat more and more with users or learn more and more from external sources, they become more and more knowledgeable and better and better at conversing. The book presents the latest developments and techniques for building such continual learning dialogue systems that continuously learn new language expressions and lexical and factual knowledge during conversation from users and off conversation from external sources, acquire new training examples during conversation, and learn conversational skills. Apart from these general topics, existing works on continual learning of some specific aspects of dialogue systems are also surveyed. The book concludes with a discussion of open challenges for future research.", "label": 0}

However, existing approaches require labeled data for the target domain which can be difficult to obtain. Furthermore, they do not have the mechanism to still recover the model's ability to access the target domain. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised non-transferable learning method for the text classification task that does not require annotated target domain data.

In task-oriented dialogue (ToD) systems, language models can be used for end-to-end training without relying on dialogue state tracking to track the dialogue history but allowing the language models to generate responses according to the context given as input. This paper conducts a comparative study to show the effectiveness and strength of using recent pretrained models for fine-tuning, such as BART and T5, on endto-end ToD systems. The experimental results show substantial performance improvements after language model fine-tuning. The models produce more fluent responses after adding knowledge to the context that guides the model to avoid hallucination and generate accurate entities in the generated responses. Furthermore, we found that BART and T5 outperform GPT-based models in BLEU and F1 scores and achieve state-of-the-art performance in a ToD system.", "label": 0}

Hwang, Saya Kanno, Hiromi Wakaki, Yuki Mitsufuji, Antoine Bosselut\nAbstract: Understanding rich narratives, such as dialogues and stories, often requires natural language processing systems to access relevant knowledge from commonsense knowledge graphs. However, these systems typically retrieve facts from KGs using simple heuristics that disregard the complex challenges of identifying situationally-relevant commonsense knowledge (e.g., contextualization, implicitness, ambiguity).   In this work, we propose the new task of commonsense fact linking, where models are given contexts and trained to identify situationally-relevant commonsense knowledge from KGs. Our novel benchmark, ComFact, contains ~293k in-context relevance annotations for commonsense triplets across four stylistically diverse dialogue and storytelling datasets. Experimental results confirm that heuristic fact linking approaches are imprecise knowledge extractors. Learned fact linking models demonstrate across-the-board performance improvements (~34.6% F1) over these heuristics. Furthermore, improved knowledge retrieval yielded average downstream improvements of 9.8% for a dialogue response generation task. However, fact linking models still significantly underperform humans, suggesting our benchmark is a promising testbed for research in commonsense augmentation of NLP systems.", "label": 0}

While existing methods show promising performance over the conventional text-only translation systems, they typically require paired text and image as input during inference, which limits their applicability to real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a visual hallucination framework, called VALHALLA, which requires only source sentences at inference time and instead uses hallucinated visual representations for multimodal machine translation. In particular, given a source sentence an autoregressive hallucination transformer is used to predict a discrete visual representation from the input text, and the combined text and hallucinated representations are utilized to obtain the target translation. We train the hallucination transformer jointly with the translation transformer using standard backpropagation with cross-entropy losses while being guided by an additional loss that encourages consistency between predictions using either ground-truth or hallucinated visual representations. Extensive experiments on three standard translation datasets with a diverse set of language pairs demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over both text-only baselines and state-of-the-art methods.

Motivated by semi-parametric language models (LMs), which ground their decisions in external retrieved evidence, we use few-shot prompting to learn to condition LMs on information returned from the web using Google Search, a broad and constantly updated knowledge source. Our approach does not involve fine-tuning or learning additional parameters, thus making it applicable to any LM, offering therefore a strong baseline. Indeed, we find that LMs conditioned on the web surpass performance of closed-book models of similar, or even larger, model sizes in open-domain question answering. Finally, we find that increasing the inference-time compute of models, achieved via using multiple retrieved evidences to generate multiple answers followed by a reranking stage that uses scores generated by the same LMs, leads to better performance and alleviates lower performance of smaller few-shot LMs. All in all, our findings suggest that it might be beneficial to slow down the race towards the biggest model and instead shift attention towards finding more effective ways to use models, including but not limited to, better prompting or increasing inference-time compute.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: A Novel Perspective to Look At Attention: Bi-level Attention-based Explainable Topic Modeling for News Classification\nAuthors: Dairui Liu, Derek Greene, Ruihai Dong\nAbstract: Many recent deep learning-based solutions have widely adopted the attention-based mechanism in various tasks of the NLP discipline. However, the inherent characteristics of deep learning models and the flexibility of the attention mechanism increase the models' complexity, thus leading to challenges in model explainability. In this paper, to address this challenge, we propose a novel practical framework by utilizing a two-tier attention architecture to decouple the complexity of explanation and the decision-making process. We apply it in the context of a news article classification task. The experiments on two large-scaled news corpora demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve competitive performance with many state-of-the-art alternatives and illustrate its appropriateness from an explainability perspective.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Hierarchical Phrase-based Sequence-to-Sequence Learning\nAuthors: Bailin Wang, Ivan Titov, Jacob Andreas, Yoon Kim\nAbstract: We describe a neural transducer that maintains the flexibility of standard sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models while incorporating hierarchical phrases as a source of inductive bias during training and as explicit constraints during inference. Our approach trains two models: a discriminative parser based on a bracketing transduction grammar whose derivation tree hierarchically aligns source and target phrases, and a neural seq2seq model that learns to translate the aligned phrases one-by-one. We use the same seq2seq model to translate at all phrase scales, which results in two inference modes: one mode in which the parser is discarded and only the seq2seq component is used at the sequence-level, and another in which the parser is combined with the seq2seq model. Decoding in the latter mode is done with the cube-pruned CKY algorithm, which is more involved but can make use of new translation rules during inference. We formalize our model as a source-conditioned synchronous grammar and develop an efficient variational inference algorithm for training. When applied on top of both randomly initialized and pretrained seq2seq models, we find that both inference modes performs well compared to baselines on small scale machine translation benchmarks.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Replacing Language Model for Style Transfer\nAuthors: Pengyu Cheng, Ruineng Li\nAbstract: We introduce replacing language model (RLM), a sequence-to-sequence language modeling framework for text style transfer. Our method autoregressively replaces each token in the original sentence with a text span in the target style. In contrast, the new span is generated via a non-autoregressive masked language model. The RLM generation scheme gathers the flexibility of autoregressive models and the accuracy of non-autoregressive models, which bridges the gap between sentence-level and word-level style transfer methods. To further control the style of generated sentences, we conduct a style-content disentanglement on the hidden representations of RLM. Empirical results on real-world text style transfer tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of RLM compared with other baselines.", "label": 0}

In this paper, we propose an augmented discriminator for adversarial training, which takes the target class as input to create richer features and more explicitly model equal opportunity.

{"text": "Title: Slangvolution: A Causal Analysis of Semantic Change and Frequency Dynamics in Slang\nAuthors: Daphna Keidar, Andreas Opedal, Zhijing Jin, Mrinmaya Sachan\nAbstract: Languages are continuously undergoing changes, and the mechanisms that underlie these changes are still a matter of debate. In this work, we approach language evolution through the lens of causality in order to model not only how various distributional factors associate with language change, but how they causally affect it. In particular, we study slang, which is an informal language that is typically restricted to a specific group or social setting. We analyze the semantic change and frequency shift of slang words and compare them to those of standard, nonslang words. With causal discovery and causal inference techniques, we measure the effect that word type (slang/nonslang) has on both semantic change and frequency shift, as well as its relationship to frequency, polysemy and part of speech. Our analysis provides some new insights in the study of language change, e.g., we show that slang words undergo less semantic change but tend to have larger frequency shifts over time.", "label": 0}

To address this we present an extensive human evaluation study of consultation notes where 5 clinicians (i) listen to 57 mock consultations, (ii) write their own notes, (iii) post-edit a number of automatically generated notes, and (iv) extract all the errors, both quantitative and qualitative. We then carry out a correlation study with 18 automatic quality metrics and the human judgements.

This paper documents the challenges that Perso-Arabic presents beyond the best-documented languages, such as Arabic and Persian, building on earlier work by the expert community. We particularly focus on the situation in natural language processing (NLP), which is affected by multiple, often neglected, issues such as the use of visually ambiguous yet canonically nonequivalent letters and the mixing of letters from different orthographies. Among the contributing conflating factors are the lack of input methods, the instability of modern orthographies, insufficient literacy, and loss or lack of orthographic tradition. We evaluate the effects of script normalization on eight languages from diverse language families in the Perso-Arabic script diaspora on machine translation and statistical language modeling tasks. Our results indicate statistically significant improvements in performance in most conditions for all the languages considered when normalization is applied. We argue that better understanding and representation of Perso-Arabic script variation within regional orthographic traditions, where those are present, is crucial for further progress of modern computational NLP techniques especially for languages with a paucity of resources.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: A Survey for Efficient Open Domain Question Answering\nAuthors: Qin Zhang, Shangsi Chen, Dongkuan Xu, Qingqing Cao, Xiaojun Chen, Trevor Cohn, Meng Fang\nAbstract: Open domain question answering (ODQA) is a longstanding task aimed at answering factual questions from a large knowledge corpus without any explicit evidence in natural language processing (NLP). Recent works have predominantly focused on improving the answering accuracy and achieved promising progress. However, higher accuracy often comes with more memory consumption and inference latency, which might not necessarily be efficient enough for direct deployment in the real world. Thus, a trade-off between accuracy, memory consumption and processing speed is pursued. In this paper, we provide a survey of recent advances in the efficiency of ODQA models. We walk through the ODQA models and conclude the core techniques on efficiency. Quantitative analysis on memory cost, processing speed, accuracy and overall comparison are given. We hope that this work would keep interested scholars informed of the advances and open challenges in ODQA efficiency research, and thus contribute to the further development of ODQA efficiency.", "label": 0}

Improving Machine Reading Comprehension Model with Span-based Contrastive Learning\nAuthors: Yunjie Ji, Liangyu Chen, Chenxiao Dou, Baochang Ma, Xiangang Li\nAbstract: Machine Reading Comprehension with Unanswerable Questions is a difficult NLP task, challenged by the questions which can not be answered from passages. It is observed that subtle literal changes often make an answerable question unanswerable, however, most MRC models fail to recognize such changes. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a span-based method of Contrastive Learning (spanCL) which explicitly contrast answerable questions with their answerable and unanswerable counterparts at the answer span level. With spanCL, MRC models are forced to perceive crucial semantic changes from slight literal differences. Experiments on SQuAD 2.0 dataset show that spanCL can improve baselines significantly, yielding 0.86-2.14 absolute EM improvements. Additional experiments also show that spanCL is an effective way to utilize generated questions.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: Why Do Neural Language Models Still Need Commonsense Knowledge to Handle Semantic Variations in Question Answering?\nAuthors: Sunjae Kwon, Cheongwoong Kang, Jiyeon Han, Jaesik Choi\nAbstract: Many contextualized word representations are now learned by intricate neural network models, such as masked neural language models (MNLMs) which are made up of huge neural network structures and trained to restore the masked text. Such representations demonstrate superhuman performance in some reading comprehension (RC) tasks which extract a proper answer in the context given a question. However, identifying the detailed knowledge trained in MNLMs is challenging owing to numerous and intermingled model parameters. This paper provides new insights and empirical analyses on commonsense knowledge included in pretrained MNLMs. First, we use a diagnostic test that evaluates whether commonsense knowledge is properly trained in MNLMs. We observe that a large proportion of commonsense knowledge is not appropriately trained in MNLMs and MNLMs do not often understand the semantic meaning of relations accurately. In addition, we find that the MNLM-based RC models are still vulnerable to semantic variations that require commonsense knowledge. Finally, we discover the fundamental reason why some knowledge is not trained. We further suggest that utilizing an external commonsense knowledge repository can be an effective solution. We exemplify the possibility to overcome the limitations of the MNLM-based RC models by enriching text with the required knowledge from an external commonsense knowledge repository in controlled experiments.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Design of Negative Sampling Strategies for Distantly Supervised Skill Extraction\nAuthors: Jens-Joris Decorte, Jeroen Van Hautte, Johannes Deleu, Chris Develder, Thomas Demeester\nAbstract: Skills play a central role in the job market and many human resources (HR) processes. In the wake of other digital experiences, today's online job market has candidates expecting to see the right opportunities based on their skill set. Similarly, enterprises increasingly need to use data to guarantee that the skills within their workforce remain future-proof. However, structured information about skills is often missing, and processes building on self- or manager-assessment have shown to struggle with issues around adoption, completeness, and freshness of the resulting data. Extracting skills is a highly challenging task, given the many thousands of possible skill labels mentioned either explicitly or merely described implicitly and the lack of finely annotated training corpora. Previous work on skill extraction overly simplifies the task to an explicit entity detection task or builds on manually annotated training data that would be infeasible if applied to a complete vocabulary of skills. We propose an end-to-end system for skill extraction, based on distant supervision through literal matching. We propose and evaluate several negative sampling strategies, tuned on a small validation dataset, to improve the generalization of skill extraction towards implicitly mentioned skills, despite the lack of such implicit skills in the distantly supervised data. We observe that using the ESCO taxonomy to select negative examples from related skills yields the biggest improvements, and combining three different strategies in one model further increases the performance, up to 8 percentage points in RP@5. We introduce a manually annotated evaluation benchmark for skill extraction based on the ESCO taxonomy, on which we validate our models. We release the benchmark dataset for research purposes to stimulate further research on the task.", "label": 0}

Previous efforts usually exploit large-scale entity-related text corpora or knowledge graph (KG) embeddings as auxiliary information to facilitate answer selection. However, the rich semantics implied in off-the-shelf relation paths between entities is far from well explored. This paper proposes improving multi-hop KGQA by exploiting relation paths' hybrid semantics. Specifically, we integrate explicit textual information and implicit KG structural features of relation paths based on a novel rotate-and-scale entity link prediction framework. Extensive experiments on three existing KGQA datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method, especially in multi-hop scenarios. Further investigation confirms our method's systematical coordination between questions and relation paths to identify answer entities.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Contrastive Visual Semantic Pretraining Magnifies the Semantics of Natural Language Representations\nAuthors: Robert Wolfe, Aylin Caliskan\nAbstract: We examine the effects of contrastive visual semantic pretraining by comparing the geometry and semantic properties of contextualized English language representations formed by GPT-2 and CLIP, a zero-shot multimodal image classifier which adapts the GPT-2 architecture to encode image captions. We find that contrastive visual semantic pretraining significantly mitigates the anisotropy found in contextualized word embeddings from GPT-2, such that the intra-layer self-similarity (mean pairwise cosine similarity) of CLIP word embeddings is under .25 in all layers, compared to greater than .95 in the top layer of GPT-2. CLIP word embeddings outperform GPT-2 on word-level semantic intrinsic evaluation tasks, and achieve a new corpus-based state of the art for the RG65 evaluation, at .88. CLIP also forms fine-grained semantic representations of sentences, and obtains Spearman's rho = .73 on the SemEval-2017 Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark with no fine-tuning, compared to no greater than rho = .45 in any layer of GPT-2. Finally, intra-layer self-similarity of CLIP sentence embeddings decreases as the layer index increases, finishing at .25 in the top layer, while the self-similarity of GPT-2 sentence embeddings formed using the EOS token increases layer-over-layer and never falls below .97. Our results indicate that high anisotropy is not an inevitable consequence of contextualization, and that visual semantic pretraining is beneficial not only for ordering visual representations, but also for encoding useful semantic representations of language, both on the word level and the sentence level.", "label": 0}

Despite its extensive use in many applications, like search engines and optical character recognition systems, little has been explored in medical scenarios in which complex and uncommon medical entities are easily misspelled. Correcting the misspellings of medical entities is arguably more difficult than those in the open domain due to its requirements of specificdomain knowledge. In this work, we define the task of Medical-domain Chinese Spelling Correction and propose MCSCSet, a large scale specialist-annotated dataset that contains about 200k samples. In contrast to the existing open-domain CSC datasets, MCSCSet involves: i) extensive real-world medical queries collected from Tencent Yidian, ii) corresponding misspelled sentences manually annotated by medical specialists. To ensure automated dataset curation, MCSCSet further offers a medical confusion set consisting of the commonly misspelled characters of given Chinese medical terms. This enables one to create the medical misspelling dataset automatically. Extensive empirical studies have shown significant performance gaps between the open-domain and medical-domain spelling correction, highlighting the need to develop high-quality datasets that allow for Chinese spelling correction in specific domains. Moreover, our work benchmarks several representative Chinese spelling correction models, establishing baselines for future work.", "label": 0}

It is an enormous challenge to understand such diversified data, especially via extracting the attribute-value pairs in text sequences with the aid of helpful image regions. Although a series of previous works have been dedicated to this task, there remain seldomly investigated obstacles that hinder further improvements: 1) Parameters from up-stream single-modal pretraining are inadequately applied, without proper jointly fine-tuning in a down-stream multi-modal task. 2) To select descriptive parts of images, a simple late fusion is widely applied, regardless of priori knowledge that language-related information should be encoded into a common linguistic embedding space by stronger encoders. 3) Due to diversity across products, their attribute sets tend to vary greatly, but current approaches predict with an unnecessary maximal range and lead to more potential false positives. To address these issues, we propose in this paper a novel approach to boost multi-modal e-commerce attribute value extraction via unified learning scheme and dynamic range minimization: 1) Firstly, a unified scheme is designed to jointly train a multi-modal task with pretrained single-modal parameters. 2) Secondly, a text-guided information range minimization method is proposed to adaptively encode descriptive parts of each modality into an identical space with a powerful pretrained linguistic model. 3) Moreover, a prototype-guided attribute range minimization method is proposed to first determine the proper attribute set of the current product, and then select prototypes to guide the prediction of the chosen attributes. Experiments on the popular multi-modal e-commerce benchmarks show that our approach achieves superior performance over the other state-of-the-art techniques.", "label": 0}

However, for non-language downstream tasks, a common practice is to employ task-specific designs for input, output layers, and loss functions. For instance, it is possible to fine-tune an LM into an MNIST classifier by replacing the word embedding layer with an image patch embedding layer, the word token output layer with a 10-way output layer, and the word prediction loss with a 10-way classification loss, respectively. A natural question arises: Can LM fine-tuning solve non-language downstream tasks without changing the model architecture or loss function? To answer this, we propose Language-Interfaced Fine-Tuning (LIFT) and study its efficacy and limitations by conducting an extensive empirical study on a suite of non-language classification and regression tasks. LIFT does not make any changes to the model architecture or loss function, and it solely relies on the natural language interface, enabling \"no-code machine learning with LMs.\" We find that LIFT performs comparably well across a wide range of low-dimensional classification and regression tasks, matching the performances of the best baselines in many cases, especially for the classification tasks. We also report experimental results on the fundamental properties of LIFT, including inductive bias, robustness, and sample complexity. We also analyze the effect of pretraining on LIFT and a few properties/techniques specific to LIFT, e.g., context-aware learning via appropriate prompting, calibrated predictions, data generation, and two-stage fine-tuning.

In the present work, we investigate how large this gap between human and machine transcription still is. For this purpose, we analyze and compare transcriptions of three humans on a new oral history data set. We estimate a human word error rate of 8.7% for recent German oral history interviews with clean acoustic conditions. For comparison with recent machine transcription accuracy, we present experiments on the adaptation of an acoustic model achieving near-human performance on broadcast speech. We investigate the influence of different adaptation data on robustness and generalization for clean and noisy oral history interviews.

{"text": "Title: The Curious Case of Absolute Position Embeddings\nAuthors: Koustuv Sinha, Amirhossein Kazemnejad, Siva Reddy, Joelle Pineau, Dieuwke Hupkes, Adina Williams\nAbstract: Transformer language models encode the notion of word order using positional information. Most commonly, this positional information is represented by absolute position embeddings (APEs), that are learned from the pretraining data. However, in natural language, it is not absolute position that matters, but relative position, and the extent to which APEs can capture this type of information has not been investigated. In this work, we observe that models trained with APE over-rely on positional information to the point that they break-down when subjected to sentences with shifted position information. Specifically, when models are subjected to sentences starting from a non-zero position (excluding the effect of priming), they exhibit noticeably degraded performance on zero to full-shot tasks, across a range of model families and model sizes. Our findings raise questions about the efficacy of APEs to model the relativity of position information, and invite further introspection on the sentence and word order processing strategies employed by these models.", "label": 0}

They have been shown to be associated with increased risks of mental health diseases or other abnormal behaviours in later lives. However, the identification of ACEs from textual data with Natural Language Processing (NLP) is challenging because (a) there are no NLP ready ACE ontologies; (b) there are few resources available for machine learning, necessitating the data annotation from clinical experts; (c) costly annotations by domain experts and large number of documents for supporting large machine learning models.

This resource as well as the proposed approach are aimed to facilitate the community in training transferable NLP models for effectively surfacing ACEs in low-resource scenarios like NLP on clinical notes within Electronic Health Records.

Experimental results show that the proposed SpeechMoE2 can achieve lower character error rate (CER) with comparable parameters than SpeechMoE on both multi-domain and multi-accent task. Primarily, the proposed method provides up to 1.6% - 4.8% relative CER improvement for the multidomain task and 1.9% - 17.7% relative CER improvement for the multi-accent task respectively.

In this paper, we introduce BEA-Base, a subset of the BEA spoken Hungarian database comprising mostly spontaneous speech of 140 speakers.

After defining the speech recognition subsets and task, several baselines - including classic HMM-DNN hybrid and end-to-end approaches augmented by cross-language transfer learning - are developed using open-source toolkits. The best results obtained are based on multilingual self-supervised pretraining, achieving a 45% recognition error rate reduction as compared to the classical approach - without the application of an external language model or additional supervised data. The results show the feasibility of using BEA-Base for training and evaluation of Hungarian speech recognition systems.", "label": 0}

In this paper, we discuss various classification approaches for Khmer text, ranging from a classical TF-IDF algorithm with support vector machine classifier to modern word embedding-based neural network classifiers including linear layer model, recurrent neural network and convolutional neural network. A Khmer word embedding model is trained on a 30-million-Khmer-word corpus to construct word vector representations that are used to train three different neural network classifiers. We evaluate the performance of different approaches on a news article dataset for both multi-class and multi-label text classification tasks.

We hypothesize that this measurement will be related to differences observed in parsing performance across treebanks. We motivate this by building upon previous work and then attempt to falsify this hypothesis by using a number of statistical methods. We establish that there is a statistical correlation between this measurement and parsing performance even when controlling for potential covariants. We then use this to establish a sampling technique that gives us an adversarial and complementary split. This gives an idea of the lower and upper bounds of parsing systems for a given treebank in lieu of freshly sampled data. In a broader sense, the methodology presented here can act as a reference for future correlation-based exploratory work in NLP.", "label": 0}

We tackle this challenge by creating an end-to-end caption generation system that makes extensive use of image-specific encyclopedic data. Our approach includes a novel way of using image location to identify relevant open-domain facts in an external knowledge base, with their subsequent integration into the captioning pipeline at both the encoding and decoding stages. Our system is trained and tested on a new dataset with naturally produced knowledge-rich captions, and achieves significant improvements over multiple baselines.

In other words, we train the deep neural network using the encrypted data. We conduct experiments on six Chinese datasets, three of which are constructed by ourselves. The experimental results show that the encryption method achieves satisfactory results. The performance of some models trained with encrypted data even exceeds the performance of the unencrypted method, which verifies the effectiveness of the introduced encryption method and solves the problem of data leakage to a certain extent.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: A Keyword Based Approach to Understanding the Overpenalization of Marginalized Groups by English Marginal Abuse Models on Twitter\nAuthors: Kyra Yee, Alice Schoenauer Sebag, Olivia Redfield, Emily Sheng, Matthias Eck, Luca Belli\nAbstract: Harmful content detection models tend to have higher false positive rates for content from marginalized groups. In the context of marginal abuse modeling on Twitter, such disproportionate penalization poses the risk of reduced visibility, where marginalized communities lose the opportunity to voice their opinion on the platform. Current approaches to algorithmic harm mitigation, and bias detection for NLP models are often very ad hoc and subject to human bias. We make two main contributions in this paper. First, we design a novel methodology, which provides a principled approach to detecting and measuring the severity of potential harms associated with a text-based model. Second, we apply our methodology to audit Twitter's English marginal abuse model, which is used for removing amplification eligibility of marginally abusive content. Without utilizing demographic labels or dialect classifiers, we are still able to detect and measure the severity of issues related to the over-penalization of the speech of marginalized communities, such as the use of reclaimed speech, counterspeech, and identity related terms. In order to mitigate the associated harms, we experiment with adding additional true negative examples and find that doing so provides improvements to our fairness metrics without large degradations in model performance.", "label": 0}

Our principal contribution is a decision procedure for solvability of such systems. The procedure works for every field (and even commutative ring) under mild effectiveness assumptions, and reduces a given orbit-finite system to a number of finite ones: exponentially many in general, but polynomially many when atom dimension of input systems is fixed. Towards obtaining the procedure we push further the theory of vector spaces generated by orbit-finite sets, and show that each such vector space admits an orbit-finite basis. This fundamental property is a key tool in our development, but should be also of wider interest.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Autoregressive Entity Generation for End-to-End Task-Oriented Dialog\nAuthors: Guanhuan Huang, Xiaojun Quan, Qifan Wang\nAbstract: Task-oriented dialog (TOD) systems often require interaction with an external knowledge base to retrieve necessary entity (e.g., restaurant) information to support the response generation. Most current end-to-end TOD systems either retrieve the KB information explicitly or embed it into model parameters for implicit access.~While the former approach demands scanning the KB at each turn of response generation, which is inefficient when the KB scales up, the latter approach shows higher flexibility and efficiency. In either approach, the systems may generate a response with conflicting entity information. To address this issue, we propose to generate the entity autoregressively first and leverage it to guide the response generation in an end-to-end system. To ensure entity consistency, we impose a trie constraint on entity generation. We also introduce a logit concatenation strategy to facilitate gradient backpropagation for end-to-end training. Experiments on MultiWOZ 2.1 single and CAMREST show that our system can generate more high-quality and entity-consistent responses.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Unsupervised Opinion Summarization Using Approximate Geodesics\nAuthors: Somnath Basu Roy Chowdhury, Nicholas Monath, Avinava Dubey, Amr Ahmed, Snigdha Chaturvedi\nAbstract: Opinion summarization is the task of creating summaries capturing popular opinions from user reviews. In this paper, we introduce Geodesic Summarizer (GeoSumm), a novel system to perform unsupervised extractive opinion summarization. GeoSumm involves an encoder-decoder based representation learning model, that generates representations of text as a distribution over latent semantic units. GeoSumm generates these representations by performing dictionary learning over pre-trained text representations at multiple decoder layers. We then use these representations to quantify the relevance of review sentences using a novel approximate geodesic distance based scoring mechanism. We use the relevance scores to identify popular opinions in order to compose general and aspect-specific summaries. Our proposed model, GeoSumm, achieves state-of-the-art performance on three opinion summarization datasets. We perform additional experiments to analyze the functioning of our model and showcase the generalization ability of {\\X} across different domains.", "label": 0}

However, previous encoder-decoder models lack effective representation learning to contain full semantic components of the given word, which leads to generating under-specific definitions. To address this problem, we propose a novel contrastive learning method, encouraging the model to capture more detailed semantic representations from the definition sequence encoding. According to both automatic and manual evaluation, the experimental results on three mainstream benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method could generate more specific and high-quality definitions compared with several state-of-the-art models.", "label": 0}

The goal of this study is to explain the relevance of TTS as well as the data preparation procedures. TTS relies heavily on recorded data since it can have a substantial influence on the outcomes of TTS modules. Furthermore, whether the domain is specialized or general, appropriate data should be developed to address all predicted language variants and domains. Different recording methodologies, taking into account quality and behavior, may also be advantageous in the development of the module. In light of the lack of Arabic language in present synthesizing systems, numerous variables that impact the flow of recorded utterances are being considered in order to manipulate an Arabic TTS module. In this study, two viewpoints will be discussed: linguistics and the creation of high-quality recordings for TTS. The purpose of this work is to offer light on how ground-truth utterances may influence the evolution of speech systems in terms of naturalness, intelligibility, and understanding. Well provide voice actor specs as well as data specs that will assist both voice actors and voice coaches in the studio as well as the annotators who will be evaluating the audios.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: From Unstructured Text to Causal Knowledge Graphs: A Transformer-Based Approach\nAuthors: Scott Friedman, Ian Magnusson, Vasanth Sarathy, Sonja Schmer-Galunder\nAbstract: Qualitative causal relationships compactly express the direction, dependency, temporal constraints, and monotonicity constraints of discrete or continuous interactions in the world. In everyday or academic language, we may express interactions between quantities (e.g., sleep decreases stress), between discrete events or entities (e.g., a protein inhibits another protein's transcription), or between intentional or functional factors (e.g., hospital patients pray to relieve their pain). Extracting and representing these diverse causal relations are critical for cognitive systems that operate in domains spanning from scientific discovery to social science. This paper presents a transformer-based NLP architecture that jointly extracts knowledge graphs including (1) variables or factors described in language, (2) qualitative causal relationships over these variables, (3) qualifiers and magnitudes that constrain these causal relationships, and (4) word senses to localize each extracted node within a large ontology. We do not claim that our transformer-based architecture is itself a cognitive system; however, we provide evidence of its accurate knowledge graph extraction in real-world domains and the practicality of its resulting knowledge graphs for cognitive systems that perform graph-based reasoning. We demonstrate this approach and include promising results in two use cases, processing textual inputs from academic publications, news articles, and social media.", "label": 0}

Gales\nAbstract: There has been a growing demand for automated spoken language assessment systems in recent years. A standard pipeline for this process is to start with a speech recognition system and derive features, either hand-crafted or based on deep-learning, that exploit the transcription and audio. Though these approaches can yield high performance systems, they require speech recognition systems that can be used for L2 speakers, and preferably tuned to the specific form of test being deployed. Recently a self-supervised speech representation based scheme, requiring no speech recognition, was proposed. This work extends the initial analysis conducted on this approach to a large scale proficiency test, Linguaskill, that comprises multiple parts, each designed to assess different attributes of a candidate's speaking proficiency. The performance of the self-supervised, wav2vec 2.0, system is compared to a high performance hand-crafted assessment system and a BERT-based text system both of which use speech transcriptions. Though the wav2vec 2.0 based system is found to be sensitive to the nature of the response, it can be configured to yield comparable performance to systems requiring a speech transcription, and yields gains when appropriately combined with standard approaches.", "label": 0}

The automatic detection of the formality level of a text is potentially beneficial for various natural language processing tasks, such as retrieval of texts with a desired formality level, integration in language learning and document editing platforms, or evaluating the desired conversation tone by chatbots. Recently two large-scale datasets were introduced for multiple languages featuring formality annotation. However, they were primarily used for the training of style transfer models. However, detection text formality on its own may also be a useful application. This work proposes the first systematic study of formality detection methods based on current (and more classic) machine learning methods and delivers the best-performing models for public usage. We conducted three types of experiments -- monolingual, multilingual, and cross-lingual. The study shows the overcome of BiLSTM-based models over transformer-based ones for the formality classification task. We release formality detection models for several languages yielding state of the art results and possessing tested cross-lingual capabilities.", "label": 0}

However, as Transformers are inefficient in processing long sequences, dialogue history length often needs to be truncated. To address this problem, we propose a new memory-augmented Transformer that is compatible with existing pre-trained encoder-decoder models and enables efficient preservation of history information. It incorporates a separate memory module alongside the pre-trained Transformer to effectively interchange information between the memory states and the current input context. We evaluate our model on three dialogue datasets and two language modeling datasets. Experimental results show that our method has achieved superior efficiency and performance compared to other pre-trained Transformer baselines.", "label": 0}

We analyze the relationship between natural language domains, model size, and the amount of training data used. The primary analysis tool we develop is based on subpopulation analysis with Singular Vector Canonical Correlation Analysis (SVCCA), which we apply to Transformer-based language models (LMs). We compare the latent representations of such a language model at its different layers from a pair of models: a model trained on multiple domains (an experimental model) and a model trained on a single domain (a control model). Through our method, we find that increasing the model capacity impacts how domain information is stored in upper and lower layers differently. In addition, we show that larger experimental models simultaneously embed domain-specific information as if they were conjoined control models. These findings are confirmed qualitatively, demonstrating the validity of our method.", "label": 0}

In this study, we propose a novel textual data augmentation method to generate artificial clinical notes in patients' Electronic Health Records (EHRs) that can be used as additional training data for patient outcomes prediction. Essentially, we fine-tune the generative language model GPT-2 to synthesize labeled text with the original training data. More specifically, We propose a teacher-student framework where we first pre-train a teacher model on the original data, and then train a student model on the GPT-augmented data under the guidance of the teacher. We evaluate our method on the most common patient outcome, i.e., the 30-day readmission rate. The experimental results show that deep models can improve their predictive performance with the augmented data, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.", "label": 0}

Academic re searchers identified the problem of insufficient and unlabeled data for mental health classification. To handle this issue, we have studied the effect of data augmentation techniques on domain specific user generated text for mental health classification. Among the existing well established data augmentation techniques, we have identified Easy Data Augmentation (EDA), conditional BERT, and Back Translation (BT) as the potential techniques for generating additional text to improve the performance of classifiers. Further, three different classifiers Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression (LR) are employed for analyzing the impact of data augmentation on two publicly available social media datasets.

In particular, past work has compared embeddings against \"semantic axes\" that represent two opposing concepts. We extend this paradigm to BERT embeddings, and construct contextualized axes that mitigate the pitfall where antonyms have neighboring representations. We validate and demonstrate these axes on two people-centric datasets: occupations from Wikipedia, and multi-platform discussions in extremist, men's communities over fourteen years. In both studies, contextualized semantic axes can characterize differences among instances of the same word type. In the latter study, we show that references to women and the contexts around them have become more detestable over time.", "label": 0}

Unlike previous approaches designed for short video retrieval (e.g., 5-15 seconds in duration), our approach aims to retrieve minute-long videos that capture complex human actions. One challenge of standard video-only approaches is the large computational cost associated with processing hundreds of densely extracted frames from such long videos. To address this issue, we propose to replace parts of the video with compact audio cues that succinctly summarize dynamic audio events and are cheap to process. Our method, named ECLIPSE (Efficient CLIP with Sound Encoding), adapts the popular CLIP model to an audiovisual video setting, by adding a unified audiovisual transformer block that captures complementary cues from the video and audio streams. In addition to being 2.92x faster and 2.34x memory-efficient than long-range video-only approaches, our method also achieves better text-to-video retrieval accuracy on several diverse long-range video datasets such as ActivityNet, QVHighlights, YouCook2, DiDeMo and Charades.", "label": 0}

We introduce CoDA21 (Context Definition Alignment), a challenging benchmark that measures natural language understanding (NLU) capabilities of PLMs: Given a definition and a context each for k words, but not the words themselves, the task is to align the k definitions with the k contexts. CoDA21 requires a deep understanding of contexts and definitions, including complex inference and world knowledge. We find that there is a large gap between human and PLM performance, suggesting that CoDA21 measures an aspect of NLU that is not sufficiently covered in existing benchmarks.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Privacy Leakage in Text Classification: A Data Extraction Approach\nAuthors: Adel Elmahdy, Huseyin A. Inan, Robert Sim\nAbstract: Recent work has demonstrated the successful extraction of training data from generative language models. However, it is not evident whether such extraction is feasible in text classification models since the training objective is to predict the class label as opposed to next-word prediction. This poses an interesting challenge and raises an important question regarding the privacy of training data in text classification settings. Therefore, we study the potential privacy leakage in the text classification domain by investigating the problem of unintended memorization of training data that is not pertinent to the learning task. We propose an algorithm to extract missing tokens of a partial text by exploiting the likelihood of the class label provided by the model. We test the effectiveness of our algorithm by inserting canaries into the training set and attempting to extract tokens in these canaries post-training. In our experiments, we demonstrate that successful extraction is possible to some extent. This can also be used as an auditing strategy to assess any potential unauthorized use of personal data without consent.", "label": 0}

Looking at the wide variety of approaches in the literature, two main paradigms emerge, unified and separate representations. The former uses a shared set of phonetic tokens across languages, whereas the latter uses unique phonetic tokens for each language. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study comparing multilingual NTTS systems models trained with both representations. Our results reveal that the unified approach consistently achieves better cross-lingual synthesis with respect to both naturalness and accent. Separate representations tend to have an order of magnitude more tokens than unified ones, which may affect model capacity. For this reason, we carry out an ablation study to understand the interaction of the representation type with the size of the token embedding. We find that the difference between the two paradigms only emerges above a certain threshold embedding size. This study provides strong evidence that unified representations should be the preferred paradigm when building multilingual NTTS systems.", "label": 0}

Meanwhile, there is another line of works starting with the MLP-mixer trying to achieve similar performance using mlp-based architectures. Interestingly, until now those mlp-based architectures have not been adapted for NLP tasks. Additionally, until now, mlp-based architectures have failed to achieve state-of-the-art performance in vision tasks. In this paper, we analyze the expressive power of mlp-based architectures in modeling dependencies between multiple different inputs simultaneously, and show an exponential gap between the attention and the mlp-based mechanisms. Our results suggest a theoretical explanation for the mlp inability to compete with attention-based mechanisms in NLP problems, they also suggest that the performance gap in vision tasks may be due to the mlp relative weakness in modeling dependencies between multiple different locations, and that combining smart input permutations with mlp architectures may not be enough to close the performance gap alone.", "label": 0}

While existing models show impressive results on CQA leaderboards, it remains unclear whether they are robust to shifts in setting (sometimes to more realistic ones), training data size (e.g. from large to small sets) and domain. In this work, we design and conduct the first large-scale robustness study of history modeling approaches for CQA. We find that high benchmark scores do not necessarily translate to strong robustness, and that various methods can perform extremely differently under different settings. Equipped with the insights from our study, we design a novel prompt-based history modeling approach, and demonstrate its strong robustness across various settings. Our approach is inspired by existing methods that highlight historic answers in the passage. However, instead of highlighting by modifying the passage token embeddings, we add textual prompts directly in the passage text. Our approach is simple, easy-to-plug into practically any model, and highly effective, thus we recommend it as a starting point for future model developers. We also hope that our study and insights will raise awareness to the importance of robustness-focused evaluation, in addition to obtaining high leaderboard scores, leading to better CQA systems.", "label": 0}

In this paper, we study the faithfulness of existing systems from a new perspective of factual robustness which is the ability to correctly generate factual information over adversarial unfaithful information. We first measure a model's factual robustness by its success rate to defend against adversarial attacks when generating factual information. The factual robustness analysis on a wide range of current systems shows its good consistency with human judgments on faithfulness. Inspired by these findings, we propose to improve the faithfulness of a model by enhancing its factual robustness. Specifically, we propose a novel training strategy, namely FRSUM, which teaches the model to defend against both explicit adversarial samples and implicit factual adversarial perturbations. Extensive automatic and human evaluation results show that FRSUM consistently improves the faithfulness of various Seq2Seq models, such as T5, BART.", "label": 0}

However, for neural network-based music generation, it is difficult to do so due to the lack of labelled data on musical form. In this paper, we develop MeloForm, a system that generates melody with musical form using expert systems and neural networks. Specifically, 1) we design an expert system to generate a melody by developing musical elements from motifs to phrases then to sections with repetitions and variations according to pre-given musical form; 2) considering the generated melody is lack of musical richness, we design a Transformer based refinement model to improve the melody without changing its musical form. MeloForm enjoys the advantages of precise musical form control by expert systems and musical richness learning via neural models. Both subjective and objective experimental evaluations demonstrate that MeloForm generates melodies with precise musical form control with 97.79% accuracy, and outperforms baseline systems in terms of subjective evaluation score by 0.75, 0.50, 0.86 and 0.89 in structure, thematic, richness and overall quality, without any labelled musical form data.

Studies of multilingual models have so far focused on performance, consistency, and cross-lingual generalisation. However, with their wide-spread application in the wild and downstream societal impact, it is important to put multilingual models under the same scrutiny as monolingual models. This work investigates the group fairness of multilingual models, asking whether these models are equally fair across languages. To this end, we create a new four-way multilingual dataset of parallel cloze test examples (MozArt), equipped with demographic information (balanced with regard to gender and native tongue) about the test participants. We evaluate three multilingual models on MozArt -- mBERT, XLM-R, and mT5 -- and show that across the four target languages, the three models exhibit different levels of group disparity, e.g., exhibiting near-equal risk for Spanish, but high levels of disparity for German.", "label": 0}

They predict continuous quantity accompanied by their sampling techniques in the generation, making evaluation complicated and intractable to get marginal distributions. Based on a recent trend that multimodal generative evaluations exploit a vison-and-language pre-trained model, we propose the negative Gaussian cross-mutual information using the CLIP features as a unified metric, coined by Mutual Information Divergence (MID). To validate, we extensively compare it with competing metrics using carefully-generated or human-annotated judgments in text-to-image generation and image captioning tasks. The proposed MID significantly outperforms the competitive methods by having consistency across benchmarks, sample parsimony, and robustness toward the exploited CLIP model. We look forward to seeing the underrepresented implications of the Gaussian cross-mutual information in multimodal representation learning and the future works based on this novel proposition.", "label": 0}

There are about 400,000 answers with more than 20 million characters. Although all answers have been scored by human examiners, handwritten characters are not labelled. We present our attempt to adapt deep neural network-based handwriting recognizers trained on a labelled handwriting dataset into this unlabeled answer set. Our proposed method combines different training strategies, ensembles multiple recognizers, and uses a language model built from a large general corpus to avoid overfitting into specific data. In our experiment, the proposed method records character accuracy of over 97% using about 2,000 verified labelled answers that account for less than 0.5% of the dataset. Then, the recognized answers are fed into a pre-trained automatic scoring system based on the BERT model without correcting misrecognized characters and providing rubric annotations. The automatic scoring system achieves from 0.84 to 0.98 of Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK). As QWK is over 0.8, it represents acceptable similarity of scoring between the automatic scoring system and the human examiners. These results are promising for further research on end-to-end automatic scoring of descriptive answers.", "label": 0}

However, existing conversational recommendation systems (CRS) ignore the advantage of user interest shift in connecting recommendation and conversation, which leads to an ineffective loose coupling structure of CRS. To address this issue, by modeling the recommendation actions as recommendation paths in a knowledge graph (KG), we propose DICR (Dual Imitation for Conversational Recommendation), which designs a dual imitation to explicitly align the recommendation paths and user interest shift paths in a recommendation module and a conversation module, respectively. By exchanging alignment signals, DICR achieves bidirectional promotion between recommendation and conversation modules and generates high-quality responses with accurate recommendations and coherent explanations. Experiments demonstrate that DICR outperforms the state-of-the-art models on recommendation and conversation performance with automatic, human, and novel explainability metrics.", "label": 0}

It is a challenging task because the biomedical questions are professional and usually vary widely. Existing question answering methods answer all questions with a homogeneous model, leading to various types of questions competing for the shared parameters, which will confuse the model decision for each single type of questions. In this paper, in order to alleviate the parameter competition problem, we propose a Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) based question answering method called MoEBQA that decouples the computation for different types of questions by sparse routing. To be specific, we split a pretrained Transformer model into bottom and top blocks. The bottom blocks are shared by all the examples, aiming to capture the general features. The top blocks are extended to an MoE version that consists of a series of independent experts, where each example is assigned to a few experts according to its underlying question type. MoEBQA automatically learns the routing strategy in an end-to-end manner so that each expert tends to deal with the question types it is expert in. We evaluate MoEBQA on three BQA datasets constructed based on real examinations. The results show that our MoE extension significantly boosts the performance of question answering models and achieves new state-of-the-art performance. In addition, we elaborately analyze our MoE modules to reveal how MoEBQA works and find that it can automatically group the questions into human-readable clusters.", "label": 0}

To address the question, we propose a Multiple Heads Student architecture (MHS), an efficient neural network designed to distill an ensemble of large transformers into a single smaller model. An MHS model consists of two components: a stack of transformer layers that is used to encode inputs, and a set of ranking heads; each of them is trained by distilling a different large transformer architecture. Unlike traditional distillation techniques, our approach leverages individual models in ensemble as teachers in a way that preserves the diversity of the ensemble members. The resulting model captures the knowledge of different types of transformer models by using just a few extra parameters. We show the effectiveness of MHS on three English datasets for AS2; our proposed approach outperforms all single-model distillations we consider, rivaling the state-of-the-art large AS2 models that have 2.7x more parameters and run 2.5x slower.", "label": 0}

Recently, many data-driven approaches are proposed for the development of CGEC research. However, there are two major limitations in the CGEC field: First, the lack of high-quality annotated training corpora prevents the performance of existing CGEC models from being significantly improved. Second, the grammatical errors in widely used test sets are not made by native Chinese speakers, resulting in a significant gap between the CGEC models and the real application. In this paper, we propose a linguistic rules-based approach to construct large-scale CGEC training corpora with automatically generated grammatical errors. Additionally, we present a challenging CGEC benchmark derived entirely from errors made by native Chinese speakers in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments and detailed analyses not only demonstrate that the training data constructed by our method effectively improves the performance of CGEC models, but also reflect that our benchmark is an excellent resource for further development of the CGEC field.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Reasoning Through Memorization: Nearest Neighbor Knowledge Graph Embeddings\nAuthors: Ningyu Zhang, Xin Xie, Xiang Chen, Xu Cheng, Huajun Chen\nAbstract: Previous knowledge graph embedding approaches usually map entities to representations and utilize score functions to predict the target entities, yet they struggle to reason rare or emerging unseen entities. In this paper, we propose kNN-KGE, a new knowledge graph embedding approach with pre-trained language models, by linearly interpolating its entity distribution with k-nearest neighbors. We compute the nearest neighbors based on the distance in the entity embedding space from the knowledge store. Our approach can allow rare or emerging entities to be memorized explicitly rather than implicitly in model parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can improve inductive and transductive link prediction results and yield better performance for low-resource settings with only a few triples, which might be easier to reason via explicit memory.

In this paper, we propose a novel manual-guided dialogue scheme to alleviate these problems, where the agent learns the tasks from both dialogue and manuals. The manual is an unstructured textual document that guides the agent in interacting with users and the database during the conversation. Our proposed scheme reduces the dependence of dialogue models on fine-grained domain ontology, and makes them more flexible to adapt to various domains. We then contribute a fully-annotated multi-domain dataset MagDial to support our scheme. It introduces three dialogue modeling subtasks: instruction matching, argument filling, and response generation. Modeling these subtasks is consistent with the human agent's behavior patterns. Experiments demonstrate that the manual-guided dialogue scheme improves data efficiency and domain scalability in building dialogue systems. The dataset and benchmark will be publicly available for promoting future research.", "label": 0}

The manual and non-manual components of the signing have been linguistically annotated using SignStream(R). The recently expanded video corpora can be browsed and searched through the Data Access Interface (DAI 2) we have designed; it is possible to carry out complex searches. The data from our corpora can also be downloaded; annotations are available in an XML export format. We have also developed the ASLLRP Sign Bank, which contains almost 6,000 sign entries for lexical signs, with distinct English-based glosses, with a total of 41,830 examples of lexical signs (in addition to about 300 gestures, over 1,000 fingerspelled signs, and 475 classifier examples). The Sign Bank is likewise accessible and searchable on the Internet; it can also be accessed from within SignStream(R) (software to facilitate linguistic annotation and analysis of visual language data) to make annotations more accurate and efficient.

Germain, Aswin Subramanian, Jonathan Le Roux\nAbstract: Speaker diarization algorithms address the \"who spoke when\" problem in audio recordings. Algorithms trained end-to-end have proven superior to classical modular-cascaded systems in constrained scenarios with a small number of speakers. However, their performance for in-the-wild recordings containing more speakers with shorter utterance lengths remains to be investigated. In this paper, we address this gap, showing that an attractor-based end-to-end system can also perform remarkably well in the latter scenario when first pre-trained on a carefully-designed simulated dataset that matches the distribution of in-the-wild recordings. We also propose to use an attention mechanism to increase the network capacity in decoding more speaker attractors, and to jointly train the attractors on a speaker recognition task to improve the speaker attractor representation. Even though the model we propose is audio-only, we find it significantly outperforms both audio-only and audio-visual baselines on the AVA-AVD benchmark dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results with an absolute reduction in diarization error of 23.3%.", "label": 0}

Transferring data to numeric vectors is a complex task where algorithms such as tokenization, stopword filtering, stemming, and weighting of terms are used. The term frequency - inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) is the most widely used term weighting method to facilitate the search for relevant documents. To improve the weighting of terms, a large number of TF-IDF extensions are made. In this paper, another extension of the TF-IDF method is proposed where synonyms are taken into account.

Commonsense knowledge, which is crucial for robust human-centric AI, is covered by a small number of structured knowledge projects. However, they lack knowledge about human traits and behaviors conditioned on socio-cultural contexts, which is crucial for situative AI. This paper presents CANDLE, an end-to-end methodology for extracting high-quality cultural commonsense knowledge (CCSK) at scale. CANDLE extracts CCSK assertions from a huge web corpus and organizes them into coherent clusters, for 3 domains of subjects (geography, religion, occupation) and several cultural facets (food, drinks, clothing, traditions, rituals, behaviors). CANDLE includes judicious techniques for classification-based filtering and scoring of interestingness. Experimental evaluations show the superiority of the CANDLE CCSK collection over prior works, and an extrinsic use case demonstrates the benefits of CCSK for the GPT-3 language model.

{"text": "Title: IELM: An Open Information Extraction Benchmark for Pre-Trained Language Models\nAuthors: Chenguang Wang, Xiao Liu, Dawn Song\nAbstract: We introduce a new open information extraction (OIE) benchmark for pre-trained language models (LM). Recent studies have demonstrated that pre-trained LMs, such as BERT and GPT, may store linguistic and relational knowledge. In particular, LMs are able to answer ``fill-in-the-blank'' questions when given a pre-defined relation category. Instead of focusing on pre-defined relations, we create an OIE benchmark aiming to fully examine the open relational information present in the pre-trained LMs. We accomplish this by turning pre-trained LMs into zero-shot OIE systems. Surprisingly, pre-trained LMs are able to obtain competitive performance on both standard OIE datasets (CaRB and Re-OIE2016) and two new large-scale factual OIE datasets (TAC KBP-OIE and Wikidata-OIE) that we establish via distant supervision. For instance, the zero-shot pre-trained LMs outperform the F1 score of the state-of-the-art supervised OIE methods on our factual OIE datasets without needing to use any training sets.

Surprisingly, results show that syntactic and lexical neural networks largely outperform pre-trained Transformers. This seems to suggest that pre-trained Transformers have serious difficulties in adapting to radically novel texts.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Data Feedback Loops: Model-driven Amplification of Dataset Biases\nAuthors: Rohan Taori, Tatsunori B. Hashimoto\nAbstract: Datasets scraped from the internet have been critical to the successes of large-scale machine learning. Yet, this very success puts the utility of future internet-derived datasets at potential risk, as model outputs begin to replace human annotations as a source of supervision.   In this work, we first formalize a system where interactions with one model are recorded as history and scraped as training data in the future. We then analyze its stability over time by tracking changes to a test-time bias statistic (e.g. gender bias of model predictions). We find that the degree of bias amplification is closely linked to whether the model's outputs behave like samples from the training distribution, a behavior which we characterize and define as consistent calibration. Experiments in three conditional prediction scenarios - image classification, visual role-labeling, and language generation - demonstrate that models that exhibit a sampling-like behavior are more calibrated and thus more stable. Based on this insight, we propose an intervention to help calibrate and stabilize unstable feedback systems.   Code is available at https://github.com/rtaori/data_feedback.", "label": 0}

This problem had a notable advance with the proposition of more complex and scalable machine learning models. Despite this progress, the Brazilian Portuguese language still disposes only of limited linguistic resources, such as datasets dedicated to sentiment classification, especially when considering the existence of predefined partitions in training, testing, and validation sets that would allow a more fair comparison of different algorithm alternatives. Motivated by these issues, this work analyzes the predictive performance of a range of document embedding strategies, assuming the polarity as the system outcome. This analysis includes five sentiment analysis datasets in Brazilian Portuguese, unified in a single dataset, and a reference partitioning in training, testing, and validation sets, both made publicly available through a digital repository. A cross-evaluation of dataset-specific models over different contexts is conducted to evaluate their generalization capabilities and the feasibility of adopting a unique model for addressing all scenarios.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: MetaASSIST: Robust Dialogue State Tracking with Meta Learning\nAuthors: Fanghua Ye, Xi Wang, Jie Huang, Shenghui Li, Samuel Stern, Emine Yilmaz\nAbstract: Existing dialogue datasets contain lots of noise in their state annotations. Such noise can hurt model training and ultimately lead to poor generalization performance. A general framework named ASSIST has recently been proposed to train robust dialogue state tracking (DST) models. It introduces an auxiliary model to generate pseudo labels for the noisy training set. These pseudo labels are combined with vanilla labels by a common fixed weighting parameter to train the primary DST model. Notwithstanding the improvements of ASSIST on DST, tuning the weighting parameter is challenging. Moreover, a single parameter shared by all slots and all instances may be suboptimal. To overcome these limitations, we propose a meta learning-based framework MetaASSIST to adaptively learn the weighting parameter. Specifically, we propose three schemes with varying degrees of flexibility, ranging from slot-wise to both slot-wise and instance-wise, to convert the weighting parameter into learnable functions. These functions are trained in a meta-learning manner by taking the validation set as meta data. Experimental results demonstrate that all three schemes can achieve competitive performance. Most impressively, we achieve a state-of-the-art joint goal accuracy of 80.10% on MultiWOZ 2.4.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: SpeechPrompt: An Exploration of Prompt Tuning on Generative Spoken Language Model for Speech Processing Tasks\nAuthors: Kai-Wei Chang, Wei-Cheng Tseng, Shang-Wen Li, Hung-yi Lee\nAbstract: Speech representations learned from Self-supervised learning (SSL) models can benefit various speech processing tasks. However, utilizing SSL representations usually requires fine-tuning the pre-trained models or designing task-specific downstream models and loss functions, causing much memory usage and human labor. Recently, prompting in Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been found to be an efficient technique to leverage pre-trained language models (LMs). Specifically, prompt tuning optimizes a limited number of task-specific parameters with a fixed pre-trained model; as a result, only a small set of parameters is needed to be stored for each task. Prompt tuning improves computation and memory efficiency by leveraging the pre-trained LM's prediction ability. Nevertheless, such a paradigm is little studied in the speech community. We report in this paper the first exploration of the prompt tuning paradigm for speech processing tasks based on Generative Spoken Language Model (GSLM). Experiment results show that the prompt tuning technique achieves competitive performance in speech classification tasks with fewer trainable parameters than fine-tuning specialized downstream models. We further study the technique in challenging sequence generation tasks. Prompt tuning also demonstrates its potential, while the limitation and possible research directions are discussed in this paper.

Recent studies typically represent the entire document by sequence- or graph-based models to predict the relations of all entity pairs. However, we find that such a model is not robust and exhibits bizarre behaviors: it predicts correctly when an entire test document is fed as input, but errs when non-evidence sentences are removed. To this end, we propose a Sentence Importance Estimation and Focusing (SIEF) framework for DocRE, where we design a sentence importance score and a sentence focusing loss, encouraging DocRE models to focus on evidence sentences. Experimental results on two domains show that our SIEF not only improves overall performance, but also makes DocRE models more robust. Moreover, SIEF is a general framework, shown to be effective when combined with a variety of base DocRE models.", "label": 0}

In many online sites, there are options for posting reviews, and thus creating scopes for fake paid reviews or untruthful reviews. These concocted reviews can mislead the general public and put them in a perplexity whether to believe the review or not. Prominent machine learning techniques have been introduced to solve the problem of spam review detection. The majority of current research has concentrated on supervised learning methods, which require labeled data - an inadequacy when it comes to online review. Our focus in this article is to detect any deceptive text reviews. In order to achieve that we have worked with both labeled and unlabeled data and proposed deep learning methods for spam review detection which includes Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a variant of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). We have also applied some traditional machine learning classifiers such as Nave Bayes (NB), K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to detect spam reviews and finally, we have shown the performance comparison for both traditional and deep learning classifiers.", "label": 0}

Such explanations are emerging as an attractive option to provide actionable change to scenarios adversely impacted by classifiers' decisions. However, their extension to textual data is under-explored and there is little investigation on their vulnerabilities and limitations.   This work motivates textual counterfactuals by laying the ground for a novel evaluation scheme inspired by the faithfulness of explanations. Accordingly, we extend the computation of three metrics, proximity,connectedness and stability, to textual data and we benchmark two successful contrastive methods, POLYJUICE and MiCE, on our suggested metrics. Experiments on sentiment analysis data show that the connectedness of counterfactuals to their original counterparts is not obvious in both models. More interestingly, the generated contrastive texts are more attainable with POLYJUICE which highlights the significance of latent representations in counterfactual search. Finally, we perform the first semantic adversarial attack on textual recourse methods. The results demonstrate the robustness of POLYJUICE and the role that latent input representations play in robustness and reliability.", "label": 0}

In this paper, we propose \\emph{TopNet} to alleviate this problem, by leveraging the recent advances in neural topic modeling to obtain high-quality skeleton words to complement the short input. In particular, instead of directly generating a story, we first learn to map the short text input to a low-dimensional topic distribution (which is pre-assigned by a topic model). Based on this latent topic distribution, we can use the reconstruction decoder of the topic model to sample a sequence of inter-related words as a skeleton for the story.

We discover that even current strong pretrained language models struggle to answer the questions consistently, highlighting that the highest accuracy in an unsupervised setting (60.2%) is far behind human accuracy (92.5%). Through a comparison with existing datasets, we observe that the questions in our dataset contain minimal annotation artifacts in the answer options.

Considering seen and unseen speakers have diverse characteristics, zero-shot adaptive TTS requires strong generalization ability on speaker characteristics, which brings modeling challenges. In this paper, we develop AdaSpeech 4, a zero-shot adaptive TTS system for high-quality speech synthesis. We model the speaker characteristics systematically to improve the generalization on new speakers. Generally, the modeling of speaker characteristics can be categorized into three steps: extracting speaker representation, taking this speaker representation as condition, and synthesizing speech/mel-spectrogram given this speaker representation. Accordingly, we improve the modeling in three steps: 1) To extract speaker representation with better generalization, we factorize the speaker characteristics into basis vectors and extract speaker representation by weighted combining of these basis vectors through attention. 2) We leverage conditional layer normalization to integrate the extracted speaker representation to TTS model. 3) We propose a novel supervision loss based on the distribution of basis vectors to maintain the corresponding speaker characteristics in generated mel-spectrograms. Without any fine-tuning, AdaSpeech 4 achieves better voice quality and similarity than baselines in multiple datasets.", "label": 0}

While recent research efforts improve the performance of traditional ad-hoc retrieval models, legal case retrieval is still challenging since queries are legal cases, which contain hundreds of tokens. Legal cases are much longer and more complicated than keywords queries. Apart from that, the definition of legal relevance is beyond the general definition. In addition to general topical relevance, the relevant cases also involve similar situations and legal elements, which can support the judgment of the current case. In this paper, we propose an interaction-focused network for legal case retrieval with a multi-view contrastive learning objective. The contrastive learning views, including case-view and element-view, aim to overcome the above challenges. The case-view contrastive learning minimizes the hidden space distance between relevant legal case representations produced by a pre-trained language model (PLM) encoder. The element-view builds positive and negative instances by changing legal elements of cases to help the network better compute legal relevance. To achieve this, we employ a legal element knowledge-aware indicator to detect legal elements of cases. We conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark of relevant case retrieval. Evaluation results indicate our proposed method obtains significant improvement over the existing methods.", "label": 0}

Kenett, Michael S. Vitevitch\nAbstract: The mental lexicon is a complex cognitive system representing information about the words/concepts that one knows. Decades of psychological experiments have shown that conceptual associations across multiple, interactive cognitive levels can greatly influence word acquisition, storage, and processing. How can semantic, phonological, syntactic, and other types of conceptual associations be mapped within a coherent mathematical framework to study how the mental lexicon works? We here review cognitive multilayer networks as a promising quantitative and interpretative framework for investigating the mental lexicon. Cognitive multilayer networks can map multiple types of information at once, thus capturing how different layers of associations might co-exist within the mental lexicon and influence cognitive processing. This review starts with a gentle introduction to the structure and formalism of multilayer networks. We then discuss quantitative mechanisms of psychological phenomena that could not be observed in single-layer networks and were only unveiled by combining multiple layers of the lexicon: (i) multiplex viability highlights language kernels and facilitative effects of knowledge processing in healthy and clinical populations; (ii) multilayer community detection enables contextual meaning reconstruction depending on psycholinguistic features; (iii) layer analysis can mediate latent interactions of mediation, suppression and facilitation for lexical access. By outlining novel quantitative perspectives where multilayer networks can shed light on cognitive knowledge representations, also in next-generation brain/mind models, we discuss key limitations and promising directions for cutting-edge future research.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Adaptive Ranking-based Sample Selection for Weakly Supervised Class-imbalanced Text Classification\nAuthors: Linxin Song, Jieyu Zhang, Tianxiang Yang, Masayuki Goto\nAbstract: To obtain a large amount of training labels inexpensively, researchers have recently adopted the weak supervision (WS) paradigm, which leverages labeling rules to synthesize training labels rather than using individual annotations to achieve competitive results for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, data imbalance is often overlooked in applying the WS paradigm, despite being a common issue in a variety of NLP tasks. To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Ranking-based Sample Selection (ARS2), a model-agnostic framework to alleviate the data imbalance issue in the WS paradigm. Specifically, it calculates a probabilistic margin score based on the output of the current model to measure and rank the cleanliness of each data point. Then, the ranked data are sampled based on both class-wise and rule-aware ranking. In particular, the two sample strategies corresponds to our motivations: (1) to train the model with balanced data batches to reduce the data imbalance issue and (2) to exploit the expertise of each labeling rule for collecting clean samples. Experiments on four text classification datasets with four different imbalance ratios show that ARS2 outperformed the state-of-the-art imbalanced learning and WS methods, leading to a 2%-57.8% improvement on their F1-score.", "label": 0}

However, these systems model sequence labeling as a sequence prediction task causing a divergence from its well-established token-level tagging formulation. We build compositional end-to-end SLU systems that explicitly separate the added complexity of recognizing spoken mentions in SLU from the NLU task of sequence labeling. By relying on intermediate decoders trained for ASR, our end-to-end systems transform the input modality from speech to token-level representations that can be used in the traditional sequence labeling framework. This composition of ASR and NLU formulations in our end-to-end SLU system offers direct compatibility with pre-trained ASR and NLU systems, allows performance monitoring of individual components and enables the use of globally normalized losses like CRF, making them attractive in practical scenarios. Our models outperform both cascaded and direct end-to-end models on a labeling task of named entity recognition across SLU benchmarks.", "label": 0}

Automatically identifying and characterizing the behavior of such active citizens in social media is an important task in computational social science for complementing studies in misinformation analysis. In this paper, we study this task across different social media platforms (i.e., Twitter and Weibo) and languages (i.e., English and Chinese) for the first time. To this end, (1) we develop and make publicly available a new dataset of Weibo users mapped into one of the two categories (i.e., misinformation posters or active citizens); (2) we evaluate a battery of supervised models on our new Weibo dataset and an existing Twitter dataset which we repurpose for the task; and (3) we present an extensive analysis of the differences in language use between the two user categories.", "label": 0}

A key step in this process is punctuation restoration which restores fundamental text structures such as phrase and sentence boundaries from the video transcripts. This work presents a new human-annotated corpus, called BehancePR, for punctuation restoration in livestreaming video transcripts. Our experiments on BehancePR demonstrate the challenges of punctuation restoration for this domain. Furthermore, we show that popular natural language processing toolkits are incapable of detecting sentence boundary on non-punctuated transcripts of livestreaming videos, calling for more research effort to develop robust models for this area.", "label": 0}

These information might be available in multiple languages due to the nature of user generated content. An effective system to automatically identify and categorize these actionable information should be capable to handle multiple languages and under limited supervision. However, existing works mostly focus on English language only with the assumption that sufficient labeled data is available. To overcome these challenges, we propose a multilingual disaster related text classification system which is capable to work under \\{mono, cross and multi\\} lingual scenarios and under limited supervision. Our end-to-end trainable framework combines the versatility of graph neural networks, by applying over the corpus, with the power of transformer based large language models, over examples, with the help of cross-attention between the two. We evaluate our framework over total nine English, Non-English and monolingual datasets in \\{mono, cross and multi\\} lingual classification scenarios. Our framework outperforms state-of-the-art models in disaster domain and multilingual BERT baseline in terms of Weighted F$_1$ score. We also show the generalizability of the proposed model under limited supervision.", "label": 0}

Yet, robotic manipulation is extremely challenging as it requires fine-grained motor control, long-term memory as well as generalization to previously unseen tasks and environments. To address these challenges, we propose a unified transformer-based approach that takes into account multiple inputs. In particular, our transformer architecture integrates (i) natural language instructions and (ii) multi-view scene observations while (iii) keeping track of the full history of observations and actions. Such an approach enables learning dependencies between history and instructions and improves manipulation precision using multiple views. We evaluate our method on the challenging RLBench benchmark and on a real-world robot. Notably, our approach scales to 74 diverse RLBench tasks and outperforms the state of the art. We also address instruction-conditioned tasks and demonstrate excellent generalization to previously unseen variations.", "label": 0}

Recent work shows that the attention mechanism inside Transformer may not be necessary, both convolutional neural networks and multi-layer perceptron based models have also been investigated as Transformer alternatives. In this paper, we consider a graph recurrent network for language model pre-training, which builds a graph structure for each sequence with local token-level communications, together with a sentence-level representation decoupled from other tokens. The original model performs well in domain-specific text classification under supervised training, however, its potential in learning transfer knowledge by self-supervised way has not been fully exploited. We fill this gap by optimizing the architecture and verifying its effectiveness in more general language understanding tasks, for both English and Chinese languages. As for model efficiency, instead of the quadratic complexity in Transformer-based models, our model has linear complexity and performs more efficiently during inference. Moreover, we find that our model can generate more diverse outputs with less contextualized feature redundancy than existing attention-based models.", "label": 0}

Hearst\nAbstract: In the summarization domain, a key requirement for summaries is to be factually consistent with the input document. Previous work has found that natural language inference (NLI) models do not perform competitively when applied to inconsistency detection. In this work, we revisit the use of NLI for inconsistency detection, finding that past work suffered from a mismatch in input granularity between NLI datasets (sentence-level), and inconsistency detection (document level). We provide a highly effective and light-weight method called SummaCConv that enables NLI models to be successfully used for this task by segmenting documents into sentence units and aggregating scores between pairs of sentences. On our newly introduced benchmark called SummaC (Summary Consistency) consisting of six large inconsistency detection datasets, SummaCConv obtains state-of-the-art results with a balanced accuracy of 74.4%, a 5% point improvement compared to prior work.

{"text": "Title: Personalized Prompt Learning for Explainable Recommendation\nAuthors: Lei Li, Yongfeng Zhang, Li Chen\nAbstract: Providing user-understandable explanations to justify recommendations could help users better understand the recommended items, increase the system's ease of use, and gain users' trust. A typical approach to realize it is natural language generation. However, previous works mostly adopt recurrent neural networks to meet the ends, leaving the potentially more effective pre-trained Transformer models under-explored. In fact, user and item IDs, as important identifiers in recommender systems, are inherently in different semantic space as words that pre-trained models were already trained on. Thus, how to effectively fuse IDs into such models becomes a critical issue. Inspired by recent advancement in prompt learning, we come up with two solutions: find alternative words to represent IDs (called discrete prompt learning), and directly input ID vectors to a pre-trained model (termed continuous prompt learning). In the latter case, ID vectors are randomly initialized but the model is trained in advance on large corpora, so they are actually in different learning stages. To bridge the gap, we further propose two training strategies: sequential tuning and recommendation as regularization. Extensive experiments show that our continuous prompt learning approach equipped with the training strategies consistently outperforms strong baselines on three datasets of explainable recommendation.", "label": 0}

This work presents TPU-MLIR, an end-to-end compiler based on MLIR that deploys pre-trained neural network (NN) models to a custom ASIC called a Tensor Processing Unit (TPU). TPU-MLIR defines two new dialects to implement its functionality: 1. a Tensor operation (TOP) dialect that encodes the deep learning graph semantics and independent of the deep learning framework and 2. a TPU kernel dialect to provide a standard kernel computation on TPU. A NN model is translated to the TOP dialect and then lowered to the TPU dialect for different TPUs according to the chip's configuration. We demonstrate how to use the MLIR pass pipeline to organize and perform optimization on TPU to generate machine code. The paper also presents a verification procedure to ensure the correctness of each transform stage.", "label": 0}

Today, automated speaker recognition is deployed on billions of smart devices and in services such as call centres. Despite their wide-scale deployment and known sources of bias in related domains like face recognition and natural language processing, bias in automated speaker recognition has not been studied systematically. We present an in-depth empirical and analytical study of bias in the machine learning development workflow of speaker verification, a voice biometric and core task in automated speaker recognition. Drawing on an established framework for understanding sources of harm in machine learning, we show that bias exists at every development stage in the well-known VoxCeleb Speaker Recognition Challenge, including data generation, model building, and implementation. Most affected are female speakers and non-US nationalities, who experience significant performance degradation. Leveraging the insights from our findings, we make practical recommendations for mitigating bias in automated speaker recognition, and outline future research directions.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: SODAPOP: Open-Ended Discovery of Social Biases in Social Commonsense Reasoning Models\nAuthors: Haozhe An, Zongxia Li, Jieyu Zhao, Rachel Rudinger\nAbstract: A common limitation of diagnostic tests for detecting social biases in NLP models is that they may only detect stereotypic associations that are pre-specified by the designer of the test. Since enumerating all possible problematic associations is infeasible, it is likely these tests fail to detect biases that are present in a model but not pre-specified by the designer. To address this limitation, we propose SODAPOP (SOcial bias Discovery from Answers about PeOPle) in social commonsense question-answering. Our pipeline generates modified instances from the Social IQa dataset (Sap et al., 2019) by (1) substituting names associated with different demographic groups, and (2) generating many distractor answers from a masked language model. By using a social commonsense model to score the generated distractors, we are able to uncover the model's stereotypic associations between demographic groups and an open set of words. We also test SODAPOP on debiased models and show the limitations of multiple state-of-the-art debiasing algorithms.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: A Structured Span Selector\nAuthors: Tianyu Liu, Yuchen Eleanor Jiang, Ryan Cotterell, Mrinmaya Sachan\nAbstract: Many natural language processing tasks, e.g., coreference resolution and semantic role labeling, require selecting text spans and making decisions about them.   A typical approach to such tasks is to score all possible spans and greedily select spans for task-specific downstream processing.   This approach, however, does not incorporate any inductive bias about what sort of spans ought to be selected, e.g., that selected spans tend to be syntactic constituents.   In this paper, we propose a novel grammar-based structured span selection model which learns to make use of the partial span-level annotation provided for such problems.   Compared to previous approaches, our approach gets rid of the heuristic greedy span selection scheme, allowing us to model the downstream task on an optimal set of spans. We evaluate our model on two popular span prediction tasks: coreference resolution and semantic role labeling.   We show empirical improvements on both.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Bridging Fairness and Environmental Sustainability in Natural Language Processing\nAuthors: Marius Hessenthaler, Emma Strubell, Dirk Hovy, Anne Lauscher\nAbstract: Fairness and environmental impact are important research directions for the sustainable development of artificial intelligence. However, while each topic is an active research area in natural language processing (NLP), there is a surprising lack of research on the interplay between the two fields. This lacuna is highly problematic, since there is increasing evidence that an exclusive focus on fairness can actually hinder environmental sustainability, and vice versa. In this work, we shed light on this crucial intersection in NLP by (1) investigating the efficiency of current fairness approaches through surveying example methods for reducing unfair stereotypical bias from the literature, and (2) evaluating a common technique to reduce energy consumption (and thus environmental impact) of English NLP models, knowledge distillation (KD), for its impact on fairness. In this case study, we evaluate the effect of important KD factors, including layer and dimensionality reduction, with respect to: (a) performance on the distillation task (natural language inference and semantic similarity prediction), and (b) multiple measures and dimensions of stereotypical bias (e.g., gender bias measured via the Word Embedding Association Test). Our results lead us to clarify current assumptions regarding the effect of KD on unfair bias: contrary to other findings, we show that KD can actually decrease model fairness.", "label": 0}

The same is true for Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) systems that provide the access to Semantic Web data via natural language interface. While following our research agenda on the multilingual aspect of accessibility of KGQA systems, we identified several ongoing challenges. One of them is the lack of multilingual KGQA benchmarks. In this work, we extend one of the most popular KGQA benchmarks - QALD-9 by introducing high-quality questions' translations to 8 languages provided by native speakers, and transferring the SPARQL queries of QALD-9 from DBpedia to Wikidata, s.t., the usability and relevance of the dataset is strongly increased. Five of the languages - Armenian, Ukrainian, Lithuanian, Bashkir and Belarusian - to our best knowledge were never considered in KGQA research community before. The latter two of the languages are considered as \"endangered\" by UNESCO.

{"text": "Title: Debiased Learning from Naturally Imbalanced Pseudo-Labels\nAuthors: Xudong Wang, Zhirong Wu, Long Lian, Stella X. Yu\nAbstract: Pseudo-labels are confident predictions made on unlabeled target data by a classifier trained on labeled source data. They are widely used for adapting a model to unlabeled data, e.g., in a semi-supervised learning setting.   Our key insight is that pseudo-labels are naturally imbalanced due to intrinsic data similarity, even when a model is trained on balanced source data and evaluated on balanced target data. If we address this previously unknown imbalanced classification problem arising from pseudo-labels instead of ground-truth training labels, we could remove model biases towards false majorities created by pseudo-labels.   We propose a novel and effective debiased learning method with pseudo-labels, based on counterfactual reasoning and adaptive margins: The former removes the classifier response bias, whereas the latter adjusts the margin of each class according to the imbalance of pseudo-labels. Validated by extensive experimentation, our simple debiased learning delivers significant accuracy gains over the state-of-the-art on ImageNet-1K: 26% for semi-supervised learning with 0.2% annotations and 9% for zero-shot learning.

Most approaches use hand-crafted features, but their efficacy relies on their particular underlying assumptions and they risk discarding potentially salient information about proficiency. Other approaches rely on transcriptions produced by ASR systems which may not provide a faithful rendition of a learner's utterance in specific scenarios (e.g., non-native children's spontaneous speech). Furthermore, transcriptions do not yield any information about relevant aspects such as intonation, rhythm or prosody. In this paper, we investigate the use of wav2vec 2.0 for assessing overall and individual aspects of proficiency on two small datasets, one of which is publicly available. We find that this approach significantly outperforms the BERT-based baseline system trained on ASR and manual transcriptions used for comparison.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: ELMER: A Non-Autoregressive Pre-trained Language Model for Efficient and Effective Text Generation\nAuthors: Junyi Li, Tianyi Tang, Wayne Xin Zhao, Jian-Yun Nie, Ji-Rong Wen\nAbstract: We study the text generation task under the approach of pre-trained language models (PLMs). Typically, an auto-regressive (AR) method is adopted for generating texts in a token-by-token manner. Despite many advantages of AR generation, it usually suffers from inefficient inference. Therefore, non-autoregressive (NAR) models are proposed to generate all target tokens simultaneously. However, NAR models usually generate texts of lower quality due to the absence of token dependency in the output text. In this paper, we propose ELMER: an efficient and effective PLM for NAR text generation to explicitly model the token dependency during NAR generation. By leveraging the early exit technique, ELMER enables the token generations at different layers, according to their prediction confidence (a more confident token will exit at a lower layer). Besides, we propose a novel pre-training objective, Layer Permutation Language Modeling, to pre-train ELMER by permuting the exit layer for each token in sequences. Experiments on three text generation tasks show that ELMER significantly outperforms NAR models and further narrows the performance gap with AR PLMs (\\eg ELMER (29.92) vs BART (30.61) ROUGE-L in XSUM) while achieving over 10 times inference speedup.", "label": 0}

In recent years, researchers have attempted to classify readers with dyslexia based on their eye movements using Support Vector Machines (SVMs). However, these approaches (i) are based on highly aggregated features averaged over all words read by a participant, thus disregarding the sequential nature of the eye movements, and (ii) do not consider the linguistic stimulus and its interaction with the reader's eye movements. In the present work, we propose two simple sequence models that process eye movements on the entire stimulus without the need of aggregating features across the sentence. Additionally, we incorporate the linguistic stimulus into the model in two ways -- contextualized word embeddings and manually extracted linguistic features. The models are evaluated on a Mandarin Chinese dataset containing eye movements from children with and without dyslexia. Our results show that (i) even for a logographic script such as Chinese, sequence models are able to classify dyslexia on eye gaze sequences, reaching state-of-the-art performance, and (ii) incorporating the linguistic stimulus does not help to improve classification performance.", "label": 0}

To our best knowledge, there is a lack of datasets and mature research works in identifying high-quality articles. Consequently, we conduct some surveys and finalize 7 objective indicators to annotate the quality of 10k articles. During annotation, we find that many characteristics of high-quality articles (e.g., background) rely more on extensive external knowledge than inner semantic information of articles. In response, we link extracted article entities to Baidu Encyclopedia, then propose Knowledge Enhanced article Quality Identification (KE-QI) dataset. To make better use of external knowledge, we propose a compound model which fuses the text and external knowledge information via a gate unit to classify the quality of an article. Our experimental results on KE-QI show that with initialization of our pre-trained Node2Vec model, our model achieves about 78\\% $F_1$, outperforming other baselines.", "label": 0}

Revisiting Demographic Adaptation in the Age of Transformers\nAuthors: Chia-Chien Hung, Anne Lauscher, Dirk Hovy, Simone Paolo Ponzetto, Goran Glava\u0161\nAbstract: Demographic factors (e.g., gender or age) shape our language. Previous work showed that incorporating demographic factors can consistently improve performance for various NLP tasks with traditional NLP models. In this work, we investigate whether these previous findings still hold with state-of-the-art pretrained Transformer-based language models (PLMs). We use three common specialization methods proven effective for incorporating external knowledge into pretrained Transformers (e.g., domain-specific or geographic knowledge). We adapt the language representations for the demographic dimensions of gender and age, using continuous language modeling and dynamic multi-task learning for adaptation, where we couple language modeling objectives with the prediction of demographic classes. Our results when employing a multilingual PLM show substantial performance gains across four languages (English, German, French, and Danish), which is consistent with the results of previous work. However, controlling for confounding factors -- primarily domain and language proficiency of Transformer-based PLMs -- shows that downstream performance gains from our demographic adaptation do not actually stem from demographic knowledge. Our results indicate that demographic specialization of PLMs, while holding promise for positive societal impact, still represents an unsolved problem for (modern) NLP.", "label": 0}

Bader, Bo Wang\nAbstract: Motivated by the fact that many relations cross the sentence boundary, there has been increasing interest in document-level relation extraction (DocRE). DocRE requires integrating information within and across sentences, capturing complex interactions between mentions of entities. Most existing methods are pipeline-based, requiring entities as input. However, jointly learning to extract entities and relations can improve performance and be more efficient due to shared parameters and training steps. In this paper, we develop a sequence-to-sequence approach, seq2rel, that can learn the subtasks of DocRE (entity extraction, coreference resolution and relation extraction) end-to-end, replacing a pipeline of task-specific components. Using a simple strategy we call entity hinting, we compare our approach to existing pipeline-based methods on several popular biomedical datasets, in some cases exceeding their performance. We also report the first end-to-end results on these datasets for future comparison. Finally, we demonstrate that, under our model, an end-to-end approach outperforms a pipeline-based approach.

However, existing models solely rely on shared parameters, which can only perform implicit alignment across languages. We present Global--Local Contrastive Learning Framework (GL-CLeF) to address this shortcoming. Specifically, we employ contrastive learning, leveraging bilingual dictionaries to construct multilingual views of the same utterance, then encourage their representations to be more similar than negative example pairs, which achieves to explicitly aligned representations of similar sentences across languages. In addition, a key step in GL-CLeF is a proposed Local and Global component, which achieves a fine-grained cross-lingual transfer (i.e., sentence-level Local intent transfer, token-level Local slot transfer, and semantic-level Global transfer across intent and slot). Experiments on MultiATIS++ show that GL-CLeF achieves the best performance and successfully pulls representations of similar sentences across languages closer.", "label": 0}

This paper presents our approach to build generalized models for the Knowledge-grounded Task-oriented Dialogue Modeling on Spoken Conversations Challenge of DSTC-10. In order to mitigate the discrepancies between spoken and written text, we mainly employ extensive data augmentation strategies on written data, including artificial error injection and round-trip text-speech transformation. To train robust models for spoken conversations, we improve pre-trained language models, and apply ensemble algorithms for each sub-task. Typically, for the detection task, we fine-tune \\roberta and ELECTRA, and run an error-fixing ensemble algorithm. For the selection task, we adopt a two-stage framework that consists of entity tracking and knowledge ranking, and propose a multi-task learning method to learn multi-level semantic information by domain classification and entity selection. For the generation task, we adopt a cross-validation data process to improve pre-trained generative language models, followed by a consensus decoding algorithm, which can add arbitrary features like relative \\rouge metric, and tune associated feature weights toward \\bleu directly.

It is, however, shown that existing EL methods developed for annotating documents are suboptimal for conversations, where personal entities (e.g., \"my cars\") and concepts are essential for understanding user utterances. In this paper, we introduce a collection and a tool for entity linking in conversations. We collect EL annotations for 1327 conversational utterances, consisting of links to named entities, concepts, and personal entities. The dataset is used for training our toolkit for conversational entity linking, CREL. Unlike existing EL methods, CREL is developed to identify both named entities and concepts. It also utilizes coreference resolution techniques to identify personal entities and references to the explicit entity mentions in the conversations.

Previous works often design KGC models closely coupled with specific graph structures, which inevitably results in two drawbacks: 1) structure-specific KGC models are mutually incompatible; 2) existing KGC methods are not adaptable to emerging KGs.

To remedy the KG structure information loss from the \"flat\" text, we further improve the input representations of entities and relations, and the inference algorithm in KG-S2S. Experiments on five benchmarks show that KG-S2S outperforms many competitive baselines, setting new state-of-the-art performance.

A desired subgraph is crucial as a small one may exclude the answer but a large one might introduce more noises. However, the existing retrieval is either heuristic or interwoven with the reasoning, causing reasoning on the partial subgraphs, which increases the reasoning bias when the intermediate supervision is missing. This paper proposes a trainable subgraph retriever (SR) decoupled from the subsequent reasoning process, which enables a plug-and-play framework to enhance any subgraph-oriented KBQA model.

It implements three different series of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) methods, including conventional KGEs, GNN-based KGEs, and Rule-based KGEs. With a unified framework, NeuralKG successfully reproduces link prediction results of these methods on benchmarks, freeing users from the laborious task of reimplementing them, especially for some methods originally written in non-python programming languages. Besides, NeuralKG is highly configurable and extensible. It provides various decoupled modules that can be mixed and adapted to each other. Thus with NeuralKG, developers and researchers can quickly implement their own designed models and obtain the optimal training methods to achieve the best performance efficiently. We built an website in http://neuralkg.zjukg.cn to organize an open and shared KG representation learning community. The source code is all publicly released at https://github.com/zjukg/NeuralKG.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Human Perception as a Phenomenon of Quantization\nAuthors: Diederik Aerts, Jonito Aerts Argu\u00eblles\nAbstract: For two decades, the formalism of quantum mechanics has been successfully used to describe human decision processes, situations of heuristic reasoning, and the contextuality of concepts and their combinations. The phenomenon of 'categorical perception' has put us on track to find a possible deeper cause of the presence of this quantum structure in human cognition. Thus, we show that in an archetype of human perception consisting of the reconciliation of a bottom up stimulus with a top down cognitive expectation pattern, there arises the typical warping of categorical perception, where groups of stimuli clump together to form quanta, which move away from each other and lead to a discretization of a dimension. The individual concepts, which are these quanta, can be modeled by a quantum prototype theory with the square of the absolute value of a corresponding Schr\\\"odinger wave function as the fuzzy prototype structure, and the superposition of two such wave functions accounts for the interference pattern that occurs when these concepts are combined. Using a simple quantum measurement model, we analyze this archetype of human perception, provide an overview of the experimental evidence base for categorical perception with the phenomenon of warping leading to quantization, and illustrate our analyses with two examples worked out in detail.", "label": 0}

In particular, models finetuned on natural language inference datasets have been widely adopted as zero-shot classifiers due to their promising results and off-the-shelf availability. However, the fact that such models are unfamiliar with the target task can lead to instability and performance issues. We propose a plug-and-play method to bridge this gap using a simple self-training approach, requiring only the class names along with an unlabeled dataset, and without the need for domain expertise or trial and error. We show that fine-tuning the zero-shot classifier on its most confident predictions leads to significant performance gains across a wide range of text classification tasks, presumably since self-training adapts the zero-shot model to the task at hand.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Efficient Gender Debiasing of Pre-trained Indic Language Models\nAuthors: Neeraja Kirtane, V Manushree, Aditya Kane\nAbstract: The gender bias present in the data on which language models are pre-trained gets reflected in the systems that use these models. The model's intrinsic gender bias shows an outdated and unequal view of women in our culture and encourages discrimination. Therefore, in order to establish more equitable systems and increase fairness, it is crucial to identify and mitigate the bias existing in these models. While there is a significant amount of work in this area in English, there is a dearth of research being done in other gendered and low resources languages, particularly the Indian languages. English is a non-gendered language, where it has genderless nouns. The methodologies for bias detection in English cannot be directly deployed in other gendered languages, where the syntax and semantics vary. In our paper, we measure gender bias associated with occupations in Hindi language models. Our major contributions in this paper are the construction of a novel corpus to evaluate occupational gender bias in Hindi, quantify this existing bias in these systems using a well-defined metric, and mitigate it by efficiently fine-tuning our model. Our results reflect that the bias is reduced post-introduction of our proposed mitigation techniques. Our codebase is available publicly.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: BioTABQA: Instruction Learning for Biomedical Table Question Answering\nAuthors: Man Luo, Sharad Saxena, Swaroop Mishra, Mihir Parmar, Chitta Baral\nAbstract: Table Question Answering (TQA) is an important but under-explored task. Most of the existing QA datasets are in unstructured text format and only few of them use tables as the context. To the best of our knowledge, none of TQA datasets exist in the biomedical domain where tables are frequently used to present information. In this paper, we first curate a table question answering dataset, BioTABQA, using 22 templates and the context from a biomedical textbook on differential diagnosis. BioTABQA can not only be used to teach a model how to answer questions from tables but also evaluate how a model generalizes to unseen questions, an important scenario for biomedical applications. To achieve the generalization evaluation, we divide the templates into 17 training and 5 cross-task evaluations. Then, we develop two baselines using single and multi-tasks learning on BioTABQA. Furthermore, we explore instructional learning, a recent technique showing impressive generalizing performance. Experimental results show that our instruction-tuned model outperforms single and multi-task baselines on an average by ~23% and ~6% across various evaluation settings, and more importantly, instruction-tuned model outperforms baselines by ~5% on cross-tasks.", "label": 0}

In order to make full use of context information, systems can use Incomplete Utterance Rewriting(IUR) methods to simplify the multi-turn dialogue into single-turn by merging current utterance and context information into a self-contained utterance. However, previous approaches ignore the intent consistency between the original query and rewritten query. The detection of omitted or coreferred locations in the original query can be further improved. In this paper, we introduce contrastive learning and multi-task learning to jointly model the problem. Our method benefits from carefully designed self-supervised objectives, which act as auxiliary tasks to capture semantics at both sentence-level and token-level. The experiments show that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several public datasets.", "label": 0}

Therefore, it is crucial to extract structured representations of events from social streams. Generally, existing event extraction research utilizes pattern matching, machine learning, or deep learning methods to perform event extraction tasks. However, the performance of Chinese event extraction is not as good as English due to the unique characteristics of the Chinese language. In this paper, we propose an integrated framework to perform Chinese event extraction. The proposed approach is a multiple channel input neural framework that integrates semantic features and syntactic features. The semantic features are captured by BERT architecture. The Part of Speech (POS) features and Dependency Parsing (DP) features are captured by profiling embeddings and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), respectively. We also evaluate our model on a real-world dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the benchmark approaches significantly.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Making sense of spoken plurals\nAuthors: Elnaz Shafaei-Bajestan, Peter Uhrig, R. Harald Baayen\nAbstract: Distributional semantics offers new ways to study the semantics of morphology. This study focuses on the semantics of noun singulars and their plural inflectional variants in English. Our goal is to compare two models for the conceptualization of plurality. One model (FRACSS) proposes that all singular-plural pairs should be taken into account when predicting plural semantics from singular semantics. The other model (CCA) argues that conceptualization for plurality depends primarily on the semantic class of the base word. We compare the two models on the basis of how well the speech signal of plural tokens in a large corpus of spoken American English aligns with the semantic vectors predicted by the two models. Two measures are employed: the performance of a form-to-meaning mapping and the correlations between form distances and meaning distances. Results converge on a superior alignment for CCA. Our results suggest that usage-based approaches to pluralization in which a given word's own semantic neighborhood is given priority outperform theories according to which pluralization is conceptualized as a process building on high-level abstraction. We see that what has often been conceived of as a highly abstract concept, [+plural], is better captured via a family of mid-level partial generalizations.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Retrieval Augmented Visual Question Answering with Outside Knowledge\nAuthors: Weizhe Lin, Bill Byrne\nAbstract: Outside-Knowledge Visual Question Answering (OK-VQA) is a challenging VQA task that requires retrieval of external knowledge to answer questions about images. Recent OK-VQA systems use Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) to retrieve documents from external knowledge bases, such as Wikipedia, but with DPR trained separately from answer generation, introducing a potential limit on the overall system performance. Instead, we propose a joint training scheme which includes differentiable DPR integrated with answer generation so that the system can be trained in an end-to-end fashion. Our experiments show that our scheme outperforms recent OK-VQA systems with strong DPR for retrieval. We also introduce new diagnostic metrics to analyze how retrieval and generation interact. The strong retrieval ability of our model significantly reduces the number of retrieved documents needed in training, yielding significant benefits in answer quality and computation required for training.", "label": 0}

The ISCSLP 2022 Chinese-English Code-Switching Automatic Speech Recognition (CSASR) Challenge aims to promote the development of code-switching automatic speech recognition. The ISCSLP 2022 CSASR challenge provided two training sets, TAL_CSASR corpus and MagicData-RAMC corpus, a development and a test set for participants, which are used for CSASR model training and evaluation. Along with the challenge, we also provide the baseline system performance for reference. As a result, more than 40 teams participated in this challenge, and the winner team achieved 16.70% Mixture Error Rate (MER) performance on the test set and has achieved 9.8% MER absolute improvement compared with the baseline system.

Recently, instruction tuning (IT), which fine-tunes a pre-trained language model on a massive collection of tasks described via human-craft instructions, has been shown effective in instruction learning for unseen tasks. However, IT relies on a large amount of human-annotated samples, which restricts its generalization. Unlike labeled data, unlabeled data are often massive and cheap to obtain. In this work, we study how IT can be improved with unlabeled data. We first empirically explore the IT performance trends versus the number of labeled data, instructions, and training tasks. We find it critical to enlarge the number of training instructions, and the instructions can be underutilized due to the scarcity of labeled data. Then, we propose Unlabeled Data Augmented Instruction Tuning (UDIT) to take better advantage of the instructions during IT by constructing pseudo-labeled data from unlabeled plain texts. We conduct extensive experiments to show UDIT's effectiveness in various scenarios of tasks and datasets. We also comprehensively analyze the key factors of UDIT to investigate how to better improve IT with unlabeled data. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/thu-coai/UDIT.", "label": 0}

However, the existing methods and techniques show that the model's performance is highly dependent on the number of examples in training data. For many languages, having such an amount of corpora is a far-fetched dream. Taking inspiration from monolingual speakers exploring new languages using bilingual dictionaries, we investigate the applicability of bilingual dictionaries for languages with extremely low, or no bilingual corpus. In this paper, we explore methods using bilingual dictionaries with an NMT model to improve translations for extremely low resource languages. We extend this work to multilingual systems, exhibiting zero-shot properties. We present a detailed analysis of the effects of the quality of dictionaries, training dataset size, language family, etc., on the translation quality. Results on multiple low-resource test languages show a clear advantage of our bilingual dictionary-based method over the baselines.", "label": 0}

The calculation is cheap to perform and the fact that the translation improvement almost comes for free, makes it widely adopted in neural machine translation research. Despite the popularity, the method itself simply takes the mean of the model parameters from several checkpoints, the selection of which is mostly based on empirical recipes without many justifications. In this work, we revisit the concept of checkpoint averaging and consider several extensions. Specifically, we experiment with ideas such as using different checkpoint selection strategies, calculating weighted average instead of simple mean, making use of gradient information and fine-tuning the interpolation weights on development data. Our results confirm the necessity of applying checkpoint averaging for optimal performance, but also suggest that the landscape between the converged checkpoints is rather flat and not much further improvement compared to simple averaging is to be obtained.", "label": 0}

We propose a mandarin keyword spotting system (KWS) with several novel and effective improvements, including a big backbone (B) model, a keyword biasing (B) mechanism and the introduction of syllable modeling units (S). By considering this, we term the total system BBS-KWS as an abbreviation. The BBS-KWS system consists of an end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) module and a KWS module. The ASR module converts speech features to text representations, which applies a big backbone network to the acoustic model and takes syllable modeling units into consideration as well. In addition, the keyword biasing mechanism is used to improve the recall rate of keywords in the ASR inference stage. The KWS module applies multiple criteria to determine the absence or presence of the keywords, such as multi-stage matching, fuzzy matching, and connectionist temporal classification (CTC) prefix score. To further improve our system, we conduct semi-supervised learning on the CN-Celeb dataset for better generalization. In the VKW task, the BBS-KWS system achieves significant gains over the baseline and won the first place in two tracks.", "label": 0}

However, the performance of target languages still lags far behind the source language. In this paper, our analyses indicate such a performance gap is strongly associated with the cross-lingual representation discrepancy. To achieve better cross-lingual transfer performance, we propose the cross-lingual manifold mixup (X-Mixup) method, which adaptively calibrates the representation discrepancy and gives a compromised representation for target languages. Experiments on the XTREME benchmark show X-Mixup achieves 1.8% performance gains on multiple text understanding tasks, compared with strong baselines, and significantly reduces the cross-lingual representation discrepancy.", "label": 0}

We demonstrate that template-based datasets with surface-level artifacts should not be used for probing, careful comparisons with baselines should be done and that t-SNE plots should not be used to determine the presence of a feature among dense vectors representations.

Addressing \"covert\" or implicit cases of toxicity is particularly hard and requires context. Very few previous studies have analysed the influence of conversational context in human perception or in automated detection models. We dive deeper into both these directions. We start by analysing existing contextual datasets and come to the conclusion that toxicity labelling by humans is in general influenced by the conversational structure, polarity and topic of the context. We then propose to bring these findings into computational detection models by introducing and evaluating (a) neural architectures for contextual toxicity detection that are aware of the conversational structure, and (b) data augmentation strategies that can help model contextual toxicity detection. Our results have shown the encouraging potential of neural architectures that are aware of the conversation structure. We have also demonstrated that such models can benefit from synthetic data, especially in the social media domain.", "label": 0}

Despite their importance, their accurate handling has been neglected in speech-to-text (S2T) translation research, and recent work has shown that S2T models perform poorly for locations and notably person names, whose spelling is challenging unless known in advance. In this work, we explore how to leverage dictionaries of NEs known to likely appear in a given context to improve S2T model outputs. Our experiments show that we can reliably detect NEs likely present in an utterance starting from S2T encoder outputs. Indeed, we demonstrate that the current detection quality is sufficient to improve NE accuracy in the translation with a 31% reduction in person name errors.", "label": 0}

Our experiments demonstrate that top-ranked memorized training instances are likely atypical, and removing the top-memorized training instances leads to a more serious drop in test accuracy compared with removing training instances randomly. Furthermore, we develop an attribution method to better understand why a training instance is memorized. We empirically show that our memorization attribution method is faithful, and share our interesting finding that the top-memorized parts of a training instance tend to be features negatively correlated with the class label.", "label": 0}

We propose a Data Scoring task that requires assignment of each unannotated sample in a benchmark a score between 0 to 1, where 0 signifies easy and 1 signifies hard. Use of unannotated samples in our task design is inspired from humans who can determine a question difficulty without knowing its correct answer. This also rules out the use of methods involving model based supervision (since they require sample annotations to get trained), eliminating potential biases associated with models in deciding sample difficulty. We propose a method based on Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) for this task; we validate our method by showing that existing models are more accurate with respect to the easier sample-chunks than with respect to the harder sample-chunks. Finally we demonstrate five novel applications.", "label": 0}

To bridge this gap, we develop WebShop -- a simulated e-commerce website environment with $1.18$ million real-world products and $12,087$ crowd-sourced text instructions. Given a text instruction specifying a product requirement, an agent needs to navigate multiple types of webpages and issue diverse actions to find, customize, and purchase an item. WebShop provides several challenges for language grounding including understanding compositional instructions, query (re-)formulation, comprehending and acting on noisy text in webpages, and performing strategic exploration. We collect over $1,600$ human demonstrations for the task, and train and evaluate a diverse range of agents using reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and pre-trained image and language models. Our best model achieves a task success rate of $29\\%$, which outperforms rule-based heuristics ($9.6\\%$) but is far lower than human expert performance ($59\\%$). We also analyze agent and human trajectories and ablate various model components to provide insights for developing future agents with stronger language understanding and decision making abilities.

Compared with using text, employing audio requires the model to directly exploit the useful phonemes and syllables related to the video from raw speech. Moreover, we randomly add environmental noises to this speech audio, further increasing the difficulty of this task and better simulating real applications. To rectify the discriminative phonemes and extract video-related information from noisy audio, we develop a novel video-guided curriculum learning (VGCL) during the audio pre-training process, which can make use of the vital visual perceptions to help understand the spoken language and suppress the external noise. Considering during inference the model can not obtain ground truth video segments, we design a curriculum strategy that gradually shifts the input video from the ground truth to the entire video content during pre-training. Finally, the model can learn how to extract critical visual information from the entire video clip to help understand the spoken language. In addition, we collect the first large-scale spoken video grounding dataset based on ActivityNet, which is named as ActivityNet Speech dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate our proposed video-guided curriculum learning can facilitate the pre-training process to obtain a mutual audio encoder, significantly promoting the performance of spoken video grounding tasks. Moreover, we prove that in the case of noisy sound, our model outperforms the method that grounding video with ASR transcripts, further demonstrating the effectiveness of our curriculum strategy.", "label": 0}

In the post-evaluation phase, we also trained cross-lingual models that simply merged all the English treebanks and did not use word-level translations, and yet obtained better results.

However, recognizing semantically dissimilar sentences with the same words and syntax is still a challenge to Tree-RNNs. This work proposes an improvement to Dependency Tree-RNN (DT-RNN) using the grammatical relationship type identified in the dependency parse. Our experiments on semantic relatedness scoring (SRS) and recognizing textual entailment (RTE) in sentence pairs using SICK (Sentence Involving Compositional Knowledge) dataset show encouraging results.

This dataset augments images and view hierarchies from RICO, a large dataset of mobile UIs, with annotations for icons based on their shapes and semantics, and associations between different elements and their corresponding text labels, resulting in a significant increase in the number of UI elements and the categories assigned to them. We also release models using image-only and multimodal inputs; we experiment with various architectures and study the benefits of using multimodal inputs on the new dataset. Our models demonstrate strong performance on an evaluation set of unseen apps, indicating their generalizability to newer screens.

In contrast to the traditional span-based decoding, where spans are combined only based on the sum of their scores, we introduce an order-sensitive strategy, where the span combination scores are more carefully derived from an order-sensitive basis. Our decoder can be regarded as a generalization over existing span-based decoder in determining a finer-grain scoring scheme for the combination of lower-level spans into higher-level spans, where we emphasize on the order of the lower-level spans and use order-sensitive span scores as well as order-sensitive combination grammar rule scores to enhance prediction accuracy. We implement the proposed decoding strategy harnessing GPU parallelism and achieve a decoding speed on par with state-of-the-art span-based parsers. Using the previous state-of-the-art model without additional data as our baseline, we outperform it and improve the F1 score on the Penn Treebank Dataset by 0.26% and on the Chinese Treebank Dataset by 0.35%.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: DEEP: DEnoising Entity Pre-training for Neural Machine Translation\nAuthors: Junjie Hu, Hiroaki Hayashi, Kyunghyun Cho, Graham Neubig\nAbstract: It has been shown that machine translation models usually generate poor translations for named entities that are infrequent in the training corpus. Earlier named entity translation methods mainly focus on phonetic transliteration, which ignores the sentence context for translation and is limited in domain and language coverage. To address this limitation, we propose DEEP, a DEnoising Entity Pre-training method that leverages large amounts of monolingual data and a knowledge base to improve named entity translation accuracy within sentences. Besides, we investigate a multi-task learning strategy that finetunes a pre-trained neural machine translation model on both entity-augmented monolingual data and parallel data to further improve entity translation. Experimental results on three language pairs demonstrate that \\method results in significant improvements over strong denoising auto-encoding baselines, with a gain of up to 1.3 BLEU and up to 9.2 entity accuracy points for English-Russian translation.", "label": 0}

In this context, this paper proposes natural language processing algorithms to classify, segment and evaluate the results of scientific work. Initially, the proposed framework categorize the abstract texts into according to the problems intended to be solved by employing a text classification approach. Then, the abstract text is segmented into problem description, methodology and results. Finally, the methodology of the abstract is ranked based on the sentiment analysis of its results.

Existing solutions either involve a trusted aggregator or require heavyweight cryptographic primitives, which degrades performance significantly. Moreover, many existing secure FL designs work only under the restrictive assumption that none of the clients can be dropped out from the training protocol. To tackle these problems, we propose SEFL, a secure and efficient FL framework that (1) eliminates the need for the trusted entities; (2) achieves similar and even better model accuracy compared with existing FL designs; (3) is resilient to client dropouts. Through extensive experimental studies on natural language processing (NLP) tasks, we demonstrate that the SEFL achieves comparable accuracy compared to existing FL solutions, and the proposed pruning technique can improve runtime performance up to 13.7x.", "label": 0}

Gerritse, Faegheh Hasibi, Arjen P. de Vries\nAbstract: Pre-trained language models such as BERT have been a key ingredient to achieve state-of-the-art results on a variety of tasks in natural language processing and, more recently, also in information retrieval.Recent research even claims that BERT is able to capture factual knowledge about entity relations and properties, the information that is commonly obtained from knowledge graphs. This paper investigates the following question: Do BERT-based entity retrieval models benefit from additional entity information stored in knowledge graphs? To address this research question, we map entity embeddings into the same input space as a pre-trained BERT model and inject these entity embeddings into the BERT model. This entity-enriched language model is then employed on the entity retrieval task. We show that the entity-enriched BERT model improves effectiveness on entity-oriented queries over a regular BERT model, establishing a new state-of-the-art result for the entity retrieval task, with substantial improvements for complex natural language queries and queries requesting a list of entities with a certain property. Additionally, we show that the entity information provided by our entity-enriched model particularly helps queries related to less popular entities. Last, we observe empirically that the entity-enriched BERT models enable fine-tuning on limited training data, which otherwise would not be feasible due to the known instabilities of BERT in few-sample fine-tuning, thereby contributing to data-efficient training of BERT for entity search.", "label": 0}

As a step in this direction, the ArtEmis dataset was recently introduced as a large-scale dataset of emotional reactions to images along with language explanations of these chosen emotions. We observed a significant emotional bias towards instance-rich emotions, making trained neural speakers less accurate in describing under-represented emotions. We show that collecting new data, in the same way, is not effective in mitigating this emotional bias. To remedy this problem, we propose a contrastive data collection approach to balance ArtEmis with a new complementary dataset such that a pair of similar images have contrasting emotions (one positive and one negative). We collected 260,533 instances using the proposed method, we combine them with ArtEmis, creating a second iteration of the dataset. The new combined dataset, dubbed ArtEmis v2.0, has a balanced distribution of emotions with explanations revealing more fine details in the associated painting. Our experiments show that neural speakers trained on the new dataset improve CIDEr and METEOR evaluation metrics by 20% and 7%, respectively, compared to the biased dataset. Finally, we also show that the performance per emotion of neural speakers is improved across all the emotion categories, significantly on under-represented emotions.

Such trade-offs reflect a broader class of multi-objective optimization (MOO) problems in which optimization methods seek Pareto optimal trade-offs between competing goals. In this work, we first introduce a differentiable measure that enables direct optimization of group fairness (specifically, balancing accuracy across groups) in model training. Next, we demonstrate two model-agnostic MOO frameworks for learning Pareto optimal parameterizations over different groups of neural classification models. We evaluate our methods on the specific task of hate speech detection, in which prior work has shown lack of group fairness across speakers of different English dialects. Empirical results across convolutional, sequential, and transformer-based neural architectures show superior empirical accuracy vs. fairness trade-offs over prior work. More significantly, our measure enables the Pareto machinery to ensure that each architecture achieves the best possible trade-off between fairness and accuracy w.r.t. the dataset, given user-prescribed error tolerance bounds.", "label": 0}

Finlayson\nAbstract: Emotion detection is an established NLP task of demonstrated utility for text understanding. However, basic emotion detection leaves out key information, namely, who is experiencing the emotion in question. For example, it may be the author, the narrator, or a character; or the emotion may correspond to something the audience is supposed to feel, or even be unattributable to a specific being, e.g., when emotions are being discussed per se. We provide the ABBE corpus -- Animate Beings Being Emotional -- a new double-annotated corpus of texts that captures this key information for one class of emotion experiencer, namely, animate beings in the world described by the text. Such a corpus is useful for developing systems that seek to model or understand this specific type of expressed emotion. Our corpus contains 30 chapters, comprising 134,513 words, drawn from the Corpus of English Novels, and contains 2,010 unique emotion expressions attributable to 2,227 animate beings. The emotion expressions are categorized according to Plutchik's 8-category emotion model, and the overall inter-annotator agreement for the annotations was 0.83 Cohen's Kappa, indicating excellent agreement. We describe in detail our annotation scheme and procedure, and also release the corpus for use by other researchers.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Cognitive Simplification Operations Improve Text Simplification\nAuthors: Eytan Chamovitz, Omri Abend\nAbstract: Text Simplification (TS) is the task of converting a text into a form that is easier to read while maintaining the meaning of the original text. A sub-task of TS is Cognitive Simplification (CS), converting text to a form that is readily understood by people with cognitive disabilities without rendering it childish or simplistic. This sub-task has yet to be explored with neural methods in NLP, and resources for it are scarcely available. In this paper, we present a method for incorporating knowledge from the cognitive accessibility domain into a TS model, by introducing an inductive bias regarding what simplification operations to use. We show that by adding this inductive bias to a TS-trained model, it is able to adapt better to CS without ever seeing CS data, and outperform a baseline model on a traditional TS benchmark. In addition, we provide a novel test dataset for CS, and analyze the differences between CS corpora and existing TS corpora, in terms of how simplification operations are applied.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: BRIO: Bringing Order to Abstractive Summarization\nAuthors: Yixin Liu, Pengfei Liu, Dragomir Radev, Graham Neubig\nAbstract: Abstractive summarization models are commonly trained using maximum likelihood estimation, which assumes a deterministic (one-point) target distribution in which an ideal model will assign all the probability mass to the reference summary. This assumption may lead to performance degradation during inference, where the model needs to compare several system-generated (candidate) summaries that have deviated from the reference summary. To address this problem, we propose a novel training paradigm which assumes a non-deterministic distribution so that different candidate summaries are assigned probability mass according to their quality. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art result on the CNN/DailyMail (47.78 ROUGE-1) and XSum (49.07 ROUGE-1) datasets. Further analysis also shows that our model can estimate probabilities of candidate summaries that are more correlated with their level of quality.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Emotion Intensity and its Control for Emotional Voice Conversion\nAuthors: Kun Zhou, Berrak Sisman, Rajib Rana, Bj\u00f6rn W. Schuller, Haizhou Li\nAbstract: Emotional voice conversion (EVC) seeks to convert the emotional state of an utterance while preserving the linguistic content and speaker identity. In EVC, emotions are usually treated as discrete categories overlooking the fact that speech also conveys emotions with various intensity levels that the listener can perceive. In this paper, we aim to explicitly characterize and control the intensity of emotion. We propose to disentangle the speaker style from linguistic content and encode the speaker style into a style embedding in a continuous space that forms the prototype of emotion embedding. We further learn the actual emotion encoder from an emotion-labelled database and study the use of relative attributes to represent fine-grained emotion intensity. To ensure emotional intelligibility, we incorporate emotion classification loss and emotion embedding similarity loss into the training of the EVC network. As desired, the proposed network controls the fine-grained emotion intensity in the output speech. Through both objective and subjective evaluations, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed network for emotional expressiveness and emotion intensity control.", "label": 0}

However, it remains an open question, if and when transfer learning will work, i.e. leading to positive or negative transfer. In this paper, we analyze the knowledge transfer across three natural language processing (NLP) tasks - text classification, sentimental analysis, and sentence similarity, using three LLMs - BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet - and analyzing their performance, by fine-tuning on target datasets for domain and cross-lingual adaptation tasks, with and without an intermediate task training on a larger dataset. Our experiments showed that fine-tuning without an intermediate task training can lead to a better performance for most tasks, while more generalized tasks might necessitate a preceding intermediate task training step. We hope that this work will act as a guide on transfer learning to NLP practitioners.", "label": 0}

State-of-the-art methods treated this problem as a multilabel classification problem and proposed various architectures to model this problem. However, these systems did not leverage the superb performance of pretrained language models, which achieved superb performance on natural language understanding tasks. Prior work has shown that pretrained language models underperformed on this task with the regular finetuning scheme. Therefore, this paper aims at analyzing the causes of the underperformance and developing a framework for automatic ICD coding with pretrained language models. We spotted three main issues through the experiments: 1) large label space, 2) long input sequences, and 3) domain mismatch between pretraining and fine-tuning. We propose PLMICD, a framework that tackles the challenges with various strategies. The experimental results show that our proposed framework can overcome the challenges and achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of multiple metrics on the benchmark MIMIC data.

Despite impressive empirical successes on downstream tasks, we still have a limited understanding of the properties encoded by the models and the differences across models. In this work, we examine the intermediate representations for a variety of recent models. Specifically, we measure acoustic, phonetic, and word-level properties encoded in individual layers, using a lightweight analysis tool based on canonical correlation analysis (CCA). We find that these properties evolve across layers differently depending on the model, and the variations relate to the choice of pre-training objective. We further investigate the utility of our analyses for downstream tasks by comparing the property trends with performance on speech recognition and spoken language understanding tasks. We discover that CCA trends provide reliable guidance to choose layers of interest for downstream tasks and that single-layer performance often matches or improves upon using all layers, suggesting implications for more efficient use of pre-trained models.", "label": 0}

Up to now, various DETs with distinct design elements have been proposed, achieving performance on par with fine-tuning. However, the mechanisms behind the above success are still under-explored, especially the connections among various DETs. To fathom the mystery, we hypothesize that the adaptations of different DETs could all be reparameterized as low-dimensional optimizations in a unified optimization subspace, which could be found by jointly decomposing independent solutions of different DETs. Then we explore the connections among different DETs by conducting optimization within the subspace. In experiments, we find that, for a certain DET, conducting optimization simply in the subspace could achieve comparable performance to its original space, and the found solution in the subspace could be transferred to another DET and achieve non-trivial performance. We also visualize the performance landscape of the subspace and find that there exists a substantial region where different DETs all perform well. Finally, we extend our analysis and show the strong connections between fine-tuning and DETs.", "label": 0}

In this work, we propose Code4Struct to leverage such text-to-structure translation capability to tackle structured prediction tasks in NLP. For example, Event Argument Extraction (EAE) aims to convert text into event-argument structures that can be represented as a class object using code. This alignment between structures and code enables us to take advantage of Programming Language (PL) features such as inheritance and type annotation to introduce external knowledge or add constraints with ease. We exploit the analogy between PL and NLP problems, and, as a case study, we use Code4Struct to tackle the EAE task using code generation. We ask a LLM to generate code to instantiate an event class with predicted arguments given a NL sentence. Despite only using 50 training instances for each event type, Code4Struct is comparable to fully-supervised models trained on 4,202 event instances and, when given the same 50-shot data, outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) by 20.8% absolute F1.

In this paper, we present a simple approach that uses both types of PLMs for fully zero-shot learning of NLU tasks without requiring any task-specific data: A unidirectional PLM generates class-conditioned texts guided by prompts, which are used as the training data for fine-tuning a bidirectional PLM. With quality training data selected based on the generation probability and regularization techniques (label smoothing and temporal ensembling) applied to the fine-tuning stage for better generalization and stability, our approach demonstrates strong performance across seven classification tasks of the GLUE benchmark (e.g., 72.3/73.8 on MNLI-m/mm and 92.8 on SST-2), significantly outperforming zero-shot prompting methods and achieving even comparable results to strong few-shot approaches using 32 training samples per class.", "label": 0}

By modifying existing NLP tasks, we create a diverse benchmark which requires models to successfully model long-term dependencies in the text. We evaluate how existing models perform, and find that our benchmark is much more challenging than their `short document' equivalents. Furthermore, by evaluating both regular and efficient transformers, we show that models with increased context length are better able to solve the tasks presented, suggesting that future improvements in these models are vital for solving similar long document problems.

However, it is difficult-if not impossible-to utilize it to make the model conform with user's rationales for specific answers. To elicit and reinforce commonsense reasons, we propose an iterative sampling and tuning paradigm, called ILLUME, that executes the following loop: Given an image-question-answer prompt, the VLM samples multiple candidate rationales, and a human critic provides minimal feedback via preference selection, used for fine-tuning. This loop increases the training data and gradually carves out the VLM's rationalization capabilities.

We propose a hybrid pointer generator network to solve the shortcomings of reproducing factual details inadequately and phrase repetition. We augment the attention-based sequence-to-sequence using a hybrid pointer generator network that can generate Out-of-Vocabulary words and enhance accuracy in reproducing authentic details and a coverage mechanism that discourages repetition. It produces a reasonable-sized output text that preserves the conceptual integrity and factual information of the input article. For evaluation, we primarily employed \"BANSData\" - a highly adopted publicly available Bengali dataset. Additionally, we prepared a large-scale dataset called \"BANS-133\" which consists of 133k Bangla news articles associated with human-generated summaries. Experimenting with the proposed model, we achieved ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 scores of 0.66, 0.41 for the \"BANSData\" dataset and 0.67, 0.42 for the BANS-133k\" dataset, respectively.

This type of bias in item language choices can be particularly impactful for items in a medical licensure assessment, as it could pose a threat to content validity and defensibility of test score validity evidence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt using machine learning (ML) and NLP to explore language bias on a large item bank. Using a prediction algorithm trained on clusters of similar item stems, we demonstrate that our approach can be used to review large item banks for potential biased language or stereotypical patient characteristics in clinical science vignettes. The findings may guide the development of methods to address stereotypical language patterns found in test items and enable an efficient updating of those items, if needed, to reflect contemporary norms, thereby improving the evidence to support the validity of the test scores.", "label": 0}

Profitable headlines pique readers' interest and encourage them to visit a specific website. This is usually done by adding an element of dishonesty, using enticements that do not precisely reflect the content being delivered. As a result, automatic detection of incongruent news between headline and body content using language analysis has gained the research community's attention. However, various solutions are primarily being developed for English to address this problem, leaving low-resource languages out of the picture. Bangla is ranked 7th among the top 100 most widely spoken languages, which motivates us to pay special attention to the Bangla language. Furthermore, Bangla has a more complex syntactic structure and fewer natural language processing resources, so it becomes challenging to perform NLP tasks like incongruity detection and stance detection. To tackle this problem, for the Bangla language, we offer a graph-based hierarchical dual encoder (BGHDE) model that learns the content similarity and contradiction between Bangla news headlines and content paragraphs effectively. The experimental results show that the proposed Bangla graph-based neural network model achieves above 90% accuracy on various Bangla news datasets.", "label": 0}

From the composition of this phrase, machines may guess twin prime is a certain kind of prime, but it is still difficult to deduce exactly what twin stands for without additional knowledge. Here, twin prime is a jargon - a specialized term used by experts in a particular field. Explaining jargon is challenging since it usually requires domain knowledge to understand. Recently, there is an increasing interest in extracting and generating definitions of words automatically. However, existing approaches, either extraction or generation, perform poorly on jargon. In this paper, we propose to combine extraction and generation for jargon definition modeling: first extract self- and correlative definitional information of target jargon from the Web and then generate the final definitions by incorporating the extracted definitional information. Our framework is remarkably simple but effective: experiments demonstrate our method can generate high-quality definitions for jargon and outperform state-of-the-art models significantly, e.g., BLEU score from 8.76 to 22.66 and human-annotated score from 2.34 to 4.04.", "label": 0}

To better design such a sustainable future, it is necessary to understand the trends and challenges. Thus, we examined people's opinions on micro-mobility in the US and the EU using Tweets. We used topic modeling based on advanced natural language processing techniques and categorized the data into seven topics: promotion and service, mobility, technical features, acceptance, recreation, infrastructure and regulations. Furthermore, using sentiment analysis, we investigated people's positive and negative attitudes towards specific aspects of these topics and compared the patterns of the trends and challenges in the US and the EU.

We propose data selection techniques to efficiently scale training data to find the most valuable samples in massive datasets. To efficiently scale model sizes, we leverage various optimizations such as sparse transducer loss and model sharding. By training 1-10B parameter universal English ASR models, we push the limits of speech recognition performance across many domains. Furthermore, our models learn powerful speech representations with zero and few-shot capabilities on novel domains and styles of speech, exceeding previous results across multiple in-house and public benchmarks. For speakers with disorders due to brain damage, our best zero-shot and few-shot models achieve 22% and 60% relative improvement on the AphasiaBank test set, respectively, while realizing the best performance on public social media videos. Furthermore, the same universal model reaches equivalent performance with 500x less in-domain data on the SPGISpeech financial-domain dataset.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Knowledge Unlearning for Mitigating Privacy Risks in Language Models\nAuthors: Joel Jang, Dongkeun Yoon, Sohee Yang, Sungmin Cha, Moontae Lee, Lajanugen Logeswaran, Minjoon Seo\nAbstract: Pretrained Language Models (LMs) memorize a vast amount of knowledge during initial pretraining, including information that may violate the privacy of personal lives and identities. Previous work addressing privacy issues for language models has mostly focused on data preprocessing and differential privacy methods, both requiring re-training the underlying LM. We propose knowledge unlearning as an alternative method to reduce privacy risks for LMs post hoc. We show that simply applying the unlikelihood training objective to target token sequences is effective at forgetting them with little to no degradation of general language modeling performances; it sometimes even substantially improves the underlying LM with just a few iterations. We also find that sequential unlearning is better than trying to unlearn all the data at once and that unlearning is highly dependent on which kind of data (domain) is forgotten. By showing comparisons with a previous data preprocessing method known to mitigate privacy risks for LMs, we show that unlearning can give a stronger empirical privacy guarantee in scenarios where the data vulnerable to extraction attacks are known a priori while being orders of magnitude more computationally efficient. We release the code and dataset needed to replicate our results at https://github.com/joeljang/knowledge-unlearning .", "label": 0}

These models require large computational resources and are not suitable for usage on devices with limited computational resources. Knowledge distillation is a popular compression technique that can reduce the resource needs of such models, where a large teacher model transfers knowledge to a small student model. To drastically reduce memory requirements and energy consumption, we propose two extensions for a popular sentence-transformer distillation procedure: generation of an optimal size vocabulary and dimensionality reduction of the embedding dimension of teachers prior to distillation. We evaluate these extensions on two different types of ranker models. This results in extremely compressed student models whose analysis on a test dataset shows the significance and utility of our proposed extensions.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: When can I Speak? Predicting initiation points for spoken dialogue agents\nAuthors: Siyan Li, Ashwin Paranjape, Christopher D. Manning\nAbstract: Current spoken dialogue systems initiate their turns after a long period of silence (700-1000ms), which leads to little real-time feedback, sluggish responses, and an overall stilted conversational flow. Humans typically respond within 200ms and successfully predicting initiation points in advance would allow spoken dialogue agents to do the same. In this work, we predict the lead-time to initiation using prosodic features from a pre-trained speech representation model (wav2vec 1.0) operating on user audio and word features from a pre-trained language model (GPT-2) operating on incremental transcriptions. To evaluate errors, we propose two metrics w.r.t. predicted and true lead times. We train and evaluate the models on the Switchboard Corpus and find that our method outperforms features from prior work on both metrics and vastly outperforms the common approach of waiting for 700ms of silence.", "label": 0}

Adaptive user representation learning by utilizing user personalized information has become increasingly challenging due to ever-growing history data. In this work, we propose an incremental user embedding modeling approach, in which embeddings of user's recent interaction histories are dynamically integrated into the accumulated history vectors via a transformer encoder. This modeling paradigm allows us to create generalized user representations in a consecutive manner and also alleviate the challenges of data management. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by applying it to a personalized multi-class classification task based on the Reddit dataset, and achieve 9% and 30% relative improvement on prediction accuracy over a baseline system for two experiment settings through appropriate comment history encoding and task modeling.", "label": 0}

The corpus results from an elicitation experiment in which participants were asked to describe abstract visual scenes.

Given the complexity and cost of human annotation for SP, labeled data is often scarce, particularly in multilingual settings. Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at SP given only a few examples, however LLMs are unsuitable for runtime systems which require low latency. In this work, we propose CLASP, a simple method to improve low-resource SP for moderate-sized models: we generate synthetic data from AlexaTM 20B to augment the training set for a model 40x smaller (500M parameters). We evaluate on two datasets in low-resource settings: English PIZZA, containing either 348 or 16 real examples, and mTOP cross-lingual zero-shot, where training data is available only in English, and the model must generalize to four new languages. On both datasets, we show significant improvements over strong baseline methods.", "label": 0}

Recent work on the impact of PoS tags on graph- and transition-based parsers suggests that they are only useful when tagging accuracy is prohibitively high, or in low-resource scenarios. However, such an analysis is lacking for the emerging sequence labeling parsing paradigm, where it is especially relevant as some models explicitly use PoS tags for encoding and decoding. We undertake a study and uncover some trends. Among them, PoS tags are generally more useful for sequence labeling parsers than for other paradigms, but the impact of their accuracy is highly encoding-dependent, with the PoS-based head-selection encoding being best only when both tagging accuracy and resource availability are high.", "label": 0}

The dialogue data admits a wide variety of responses for a given dialogue history, especially responses with different semantics. However, collecting high-quality such a dataset in most scenarios is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a data augmentation method to automatically augment high-quality responses with different semantics by counterfactual inference. Specifically, given an observed dialogue, our counterfactual generation model first infers semantically different responses by replacing the observed reply perspective with substituted ones. Furthermore, our data selection method filters out detrimental augmented responses. Experimental results show that our data augmentation method can augment high-quality responses with different semantics for a given dialogue history, and can outperform competitive baselines on multiple downstream tasks.", "label": 0}

While dropout proves to be an effective antidote by randomly dropping a proportion of units, existing research has not examined its effect on the self-attention mechanism. In this paper, we investigate this problem through self-attention attribution and find that dropping attention positions with low attribution scores can accelerate training and increase the risk of overfitting. Motivated by this observation, we propose Attribution-Driven Dropout (AD-DROP), which randomly discards some high-attribution positions to encourage the model to make predictions by relying more on low-attribution positions to reduce overfitting. We also develop a cross-tuning strategy to alternate fine-tuning and AD-DROP to avoid dropping high-attribution positions excessively. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks show that AD-DROP yields consistent improvements over baselines. Analysis further confirms that AD-DROP serves as a strategic regularizer to prevent overfitting during fine-tuning.", "label": 0}

Keegan, Catherine Watson, Peter-Lucas Jones, Keoni Mahelona\nAbstract: Te reo M\\=aori (referred to as M\\=aori), New Zealand's indigenous language, is under-resourced in language technology. M\\=aori speakers are bilingual, where M\\=aori is code-switched with English. Unfortunately, there are minimal resources available for M\\=aori language technology, language detection and code-switch detection between M\\=aori-English pair. Both English and M\\=aori use Roman-derived orthography making rule-based systems for detecting language and code-switching restrictive. Most M\\=aori language detection is done manually by language experts. This research builds a M\\=aori-English bilingual database of 66,016,807 words with word-level language annotation. The New Zealand Parliament Hansard debates reports were used to build the database. The language labels are assigned using language-specific rules and expert manual annotations. Words with the same spelling, but different meanings, exist for M\\=aori and English. These words could not be categorised as M\\=aori or English based on word-level language rules. Hence, manual annotations were necessary. An analysis reporting the various aspects of the database such as metadata, year-wise analysis, frequently occurring words, sentence length and N-grams is also reported. The database developed here is a valuable tool for future language and speech technology development for Aotearoa New Zealand. The methodology followed to label the database can also be followed by other low-resourced language pairs.", "label": 0}

NCR is collected from the exam questions for the Chinese course in China's high schools, which are designed to evaluate the language proficiency of native Chinese youth. Existing Chinese MRC datasets are either domain-specific or focusing on short contexts of a few hundreds of characters in modern Chinese only.

A total of 20477 questions on these documents also require strong reasoning abilities and common sense to figure out the correct answers. We implemented multiple baseline models using popular Chinese pre-trained models and additionally launched an online competition using our dataset to examine the limit of current methods.

Set-to-sequence problems occur in natural language processing, computer vision and structure prediction, where interactions between elements of large sets define the optimal output. Models must exhibit relational reasoning, handle varying cardinalities and manage combinatorial complexity. Previous attention-based methods require $n$ layers of their set transformations to explicitly represent $n$-th order relations. Our aim is to enhance their ability to efficiently model higher-order interactions through an additional interdependence component. We propose a novel neural set encoding method called the Set Interdependence Transformer, capable of relating the set's permutation invariant representation to its elements within sets of any cardinality. We combine it with a permutation learning module into a complete, 3-part set-to-sequence model and demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance on a number of tasks. These range from combinatorial optimization problems, through permutation learning challenges on both synthetic and established NLP datasets for sentence ordering, to a novel domain of product catalog structure prediction. Additionally, the network's ability to generalize to unseen sequence lengths is investigated and a comparative empirical analysis of the existing methods' ability to learn higher-order interactions is provided.", "label": 0}

The model used is based on a non-attentive Tacotron architecture, where the decoder has been replaced with a normalizing flow network conditioned on the speaker identity, allowing both TTS and voice conversion (VC) to be performed by the same model due to the inherent linguistic content and speaker identity disentanglement. When used in a cross-lingual setting, acoustic features are initially produced with a native speaker of the target language and then voice conversion is applied by the same model in order to convert these features to the target speaker's voice. We verify through objective and subjective evaluations that our method can have benefits compared to baseline cross-lingual synthesis. By including speakers averaging 7.5 minutes of speech, we also present positive results on low-resource scenarios.", "label": 0}

Several data augmentation methods have been proposed to alleviate this problem.

{"text": "Title: Partial Coupling of Optimal Transport for Spoken Language Identification\nAuthors: Xugang Lu, Peng Shen, Yu Tsao, Hisashi Kawai\nAbstract: In order to reduce domain discrepancy to improve the performance of cross-domain spoken language identification (SLID) system, as an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) method, we have proposed a joint distribution alignment (JDA) model based on optimal transport (OT). A discrepancy measurement based on OT was adopted for JDA between training and test data sets. In our previous study, it was supposed that the training and test sets share the same label space. However, in real applications, the label space of the test set is only a subset of that of the training set. Fully matching training and test domains for distribution alignment may introduce negative domain transfer. In this paper, we propose an JDA model based on partial optimal transport (POT), i.e., only partial couplings of OT are allowed during JDA. Moreover, since the label of test data is unknown, in the POT, a soft weighting on the coupling based on transport cost is adaptively set during domain alignment. Experiments were carried out on a cross-domain SLID task to evaluate the proposed UDA. Results showed that our proposed UDA significantly improved the performance due to the consideration of the partial couplings in OT.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: PANDA: Prompt Transfer Meets Knowledge Distillation for Efficient Model Adaptation\nAuthors: Qihuang Zhong, Liang Ding, Juhua Liu, Bo Du, Dacheng Tao\nAbstract: Prompt-tuning, which freezes pretrained language models (PLMs) and only fine-tunes few parameters of additional soft prompt, shows competitive performance against full-parameter fine-tuning (i.e.model-tuning) when the PLM has billions of parameters, but still performs poorly in the case of smaller PLMs. Hence, prompt transfer (PoT), which initializes the target prompt with the trained prompt of similar source tasks, is recently proposed to improve over prompt-tuning. However, such a vanilla PoT approach usually achieves sub-optimal performance, as (i) the PoT is sensitive to the similarity of source-target pair and (ii) directly fine-tuning the prompt initialized with source prompt on target task might lead to catastrophic forgetting of source knowledge. In response to these problems, we propose a new metric to accurately predict the prompt transferability (regarding (i)), and a novel PoT approach (namely PANDA) that leverages the knowledge distillation technique to transfer the \"knowledge\" from the source prompt to the target prompt in a subtle manner and alleviate the catastrophic forgetting effectively (regarding (ii)). Furthermore, to achieve adaptive prompt transfer for each source-target pair, we use our metric to control the knowledge transfer in our PANDA approach. Extensive and systematic experiments on 189 combinations of 21 source and 9 target datasets across 5 scales of PLMs demonstrate that: 1) our proposed metric works well to predict the prompt transferability; 2) our PANDA consistently outperforms the vanilla PoT approach by 2.3% average score (up to 24.1%) among all tasks and model sizes; 3) with our PANDA approach, prompt-tuning can achieve competitive and even better performance than model-tuning in various PLM scales scenarios.

Many existing methods focus on modeling OOV words by modifying acoustic and language models and integrating context words cleverly into models. To train such complex models, we need a large amount of data with context words, additional training time, and increased model size. However, after getting the ASR transcription to recover context-based OOV words, the post-processing method has not been explored much. In this work, we propose a post-processing technique to improve the performance of context-based OOV recovery. We created an acoustically boosted language model with a sub-graph made at phone level with an OOV words list. We proposed two methods to determine a suitable cost function to retrieve the OOV words based on the context. The cost function is defined based on phonetic and acoustic knowledge for matching and recovering the correct context words in the decode. The effectiveness of the proposed cost function is evaluated at both word-level and sentence-level. The evaluation results show that this approach can recover an average of 50% context-based OOV words across multiple categories.", "label": 0}

Conviction Narrative Theory (CNT) places Approach and Avoidance sentiment (that which drives action) at the heart of real-world decision-making, and argues that it better captures emotion in financial markets. This research, bringing together psychology and machine learning, introduces new techniques to differentiate Approach and Avoidance from positive and negative sentiment on a fundamental level of meaning. It does this by comparing word-lists, previously constructed to capture these concepts in text data, across a large range of semantic features. The results demonstrate that Avoidance in particular is well defined as a separate type of emotion, which is evaluative/cognitive and action-orientated in nature. Refining the Avoidance word-list according to these features improves macroeconomic models, suggesting that they capture the essence of Avoidance and that it plays a crucial role in driving real-world economic decision-making.", "label": 0}

Crowdsourcing is one practical solution for this problem, aiming to create a large-scale but quality-unguaranteed corpus. In this work, we investigate Chinese OEI with extremely-noisy crowdsourcing annotations, constructing a dataset at a very low cost. Following zhang et al. (2021), we train the annotator-adapter model by regarding all annotations as gold-standard in terms of crowd annotators, and test the model by using a synthetic expert, which is a mixture of all annotators. As this annotator-mixture for testing is never modeled explicitly in the training phase, we propose to generate synthetic training samples by a pertinent mixup strategy to make the training and testing highly consistent. The simulation experiments on our constructed dataset show that crowdsourcing is highly promising for OEI, and our proposed annotator-mixup can further enhance the crowdsourcing modeling.", "label": 0}

Chow\nAbstract: Crowd sequential annotations can be an efficient and cost-effective way to build large datasets for sequence labeling. Different from tagging independent instances, for crowd sequential annotations the quality of label sequence relies on the expertise level of annotators in capturing internal dependencies for each token in the sequence. In this paper, we propose Modeling sequential annotation for sequence labeling with crowds (SA-SLC). First, a conditional probabilistic model is developed to jointly model sequential data and annotators' expertise, in which categorical distribution is introduced to estimate the reliability of each annotator in capturing local and non-local label dependency for sequential annotation. To accelerate the marginalization of the proposed model, a valid label sequence inference (VLSE) method is proposed to derive the valid ground-truth label sequences from crowd sequential annotations. VLSE derives possible ground-truth labels from the token-wise level and further prunes sub-paths in the forward inference for label sequence decoding. VLSE reduces the number of candidate label sequences and improves the quality of possible ground-truth label sequences. The experimental results on several sequence labeling tasks of Natural Language Processing show the effectiveness of the proposed model.", "label": 0}

Neural Trojan is a type of targeted poisoning attack that embeds the backdoor into the victim and is activated by the trigger in the input space. The increasing deployment of DNNs in critical systems and the surge of outsourcing DNN training (which makes Trojan attack easier) makes the detection of Trojan attacks necessary. While Neural Trojan detection has been studied in the image domain, there is a lack of solutions in the NLP domain. In this paper, we propose a model-level Trojan detection framework by analyzing the deviation of the model output when we introduce a specially crafted perturbation to the input. Particularly, we extract the model's responses to perturbed inputs as the `signature' of the model and train a meta-classifier to determine if a model is Trojaned based on its signature. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on both a dataset of NLP models we create and a public dataset of Trojaned NLP models from TrojAI. Furthermore, we propose a lightweight variant of our detection method that reduces the detection time while preserving the detection rates.", "label": 0}

In this paper, we propose a network architecture that achieves human-level accuracy in assigning bias classifications to articles. The underlying model is based on a novel Mesh Neural Network (MNN),this structure enables feedback and feedforward synaptic connections between any two neurons in the mesh. The MNN ontains six network configurations that utilize Bernoulli based random sampling, pre-trained DNNs, and a network modelled after the C. Elegans nematode. The model is trained on over ten-thousand articles scraped from AllSides.com which are labelled to indicate political bias. The parameters of the network are then evolved using a genetic algorithm suited to the feedback neural structure. Finally, the best performing model is applied to five popular news sources in the United States over a fifty-day trial to quantify political biases in the articles they display.

However, previous studies of memorization in constrained NLG tasks have only focused on counterfactual memorization, linking it to the problem of hallucinations. In this work, we propose a new, inexpensive algorithm for extractive memorization (exact training data generation under insufficient context) in constrained sequence generation tasks and use it to study extractive memorization and its effects in NMT. We demonstrate that extractive memorization poses a serious threat to NMT reliability by qualitatively and quantitatively characterizing the memorized samples as well as the model behavior in their vicinity. Based on empirical observations, we develop a simple algorithm which elicits non-memorized translations of memorized samples from the same model, for a large fraction of such samples. Finally, we show that the proposed algorithm could also be leveraged to mitigate memorization in the model through finetuning.

{"text": "Title: Revealing Patient-Reported Experiences in Healthcare from Social Media using the DAPMAV Framework\nAuthors: Curtis Murray, Lewis Mitchell, Jonathan Tuke, Mark Mackay\nAbstract: Understanding patient experience in healthcare is increasingly important and desired by medical professionals in a patient-centred care approach. Healthcare discourse on social media presents an opportunity to gain a unique perspective on patient-reported experiences, complementing traditional survey data. These social media reports often appear as first-hand accounts of patients' journeys through the healthcare system, whose details extend beyond the confines of structured surveys and at a far larger scale than focus groups. However, in contrast with the vast presence of patient-experience data on social media and the potential benefits the data offers, it attracts comparatively little research attention due to the technical proficiency required for text analysis. In this paper, we introduce the Design-Acquire-Process-Model-Analyse-Visualise (DAPMAV) framework to equip non-technical domain experts with a structured approach that will enable them to capture patient-reported experiences from social media data. We apply this framework in a case study on prostate cancer data from /r/ProstateCancer, demonstrate the framework's value in capturing specific aspects of patient concern (such as sexual dysfunction), provide an overview of the discourse, and show narrative and emotional progression through these stories. We anticipate this framework to apply to a wide variety of areas in healthcare, including capturing and differentiating experiences across minority groups, geographic boundaries, and types of illnesses.", "label": 0}

Nevertheless, it is vital to detect and moderate offensive content to maintain decency and empathy. However, mining social media texts is a complex task since users don't adhere to any fixed patterns. Comments can be written in any combination of languages and many of them may be low-resource.   In this paper, we present our system for the LT-EDI shared task on detecting homophobia and transphobia in social media comments. We experiment with a number of monolingual and multilingual transformer based models such as mBERT along with a data augmentation technique for tackling class imbalance. Such pretrained large models have recently shown tremendous success on a variety of benchmark tasks in natural language processing. We observe their performance on a carefully annotated, real life dataset of YouTube comments in English as well as Tamil.   Our submission achieved ranks 9, 6 and 3 with a macro-averaged F1-score of 0.42, 0.64 and 0.58 in the English, Tamil and Tamil-English subtasks respectively. The code for the system has been open sourced.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: Generalizing to the Future: Mitigating Entity Bias in Fake News Detection\nAuthors: Yongchun Zhu, Qiang Sheng, Juan Cao, Shuokai Li, Danding Wang, Fuzhen Zhuang\nAbstract: The wide dissemination of fake news is increasingly threatening both individuals and society. Fake news detection aims to train a model on the past news and detect fake news of the future. Though great efforts have been made, existing fake news detection methods overlooked the unintended entity bias in the real-world data, which seriously influences models' generalization ability to future data. For example, 97\\% of news pieces in 2010-2017 containing the entity `Donald Trump' are real in our data, but the percentage falls down to merely 33\\% in 2018. This would lead the model trained on the former set to hardly generalize to the latter, as it tends to predict news pieces about `Donald Trump' as real for lower training loss. In this paper, we propose an entity debiasing framework (\\textbf{ENDEF}) which generalizes fake news detection models to the future data by mitigating entity bias from a cause-effect perspective. Based on the causal graph among entities, news contents, and news veracity, we separately model the contribution of each cause (entities and contents) during training. In the inference stage, we remove the direct effect of the entities to mitigate entity bias. Extensive offline experiments on the English and Chinese datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework can largely improve the performance of base fake news detectors, and online tests verify its superiority in practice. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly improve the generalization ability of fake news detection models to the future data. The code has been released at https://github.com/ICTMCG/ENDEF-SIGIR2022.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Prompting through Prototype: A Prototype-based Prompt Learning on Pretrained Vision-Language Models\nAuthors: Yue Zhang, Hongliang Fei, Dingcheng Li, Tan Yu, Ping Li\nAbstract: Prompt learning is a new learning paradigm which reformulates downstream tasks as similar pretraining tasks on pretrained models by leveraging textual prompts. Recent works have demonstrated that prompt learning is particularly useful for few-shot learning, where there is limited training data. Depending on the granularity of prompts, those methods can be roughly divided into task-level prompting and instance-level prompting. Task-level prompting methods learn one universal prompt for all input samples, which is efficient but ineffective to capture subtle differences among different classes. Instance-level prompting methods learn a specific prompt for each input, though effective but inefficient. In this work, we develop a novel prototype-based prompt learning method to overcome the above limitations. In particular, we focus on few-shot image recognition tasks on pretrained vision-language models (PVLMs) and develop a method of prompting through prototype (PTP), where we define $K$ image prototypes and $K$ prompt prototypes. In PTP, the image prototype represents a centroid of a certain image cluster in the latent space and a prompt prototype is defined as a soft prompt in the continuous space. The similarity between a query image and an image prototype determines how much this prediction relies on the corresponding prompt prototype. Hence, in PTP, similar images will utilize similar prompting ways. Through extensive experiments on seven real-world benchmarks, we show that PTP is an effective method to leverage the latent knowledge and adaptive to various PVLMs. Moreover, through detailed analysis, we discuss pros and cons for prompt learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning under the context of few-shot learning.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Transformers with Learnable Activation Functions\nAuthors: Haishuo Fang, Ji-Ung Lee, Nafise Sadat Moosavi, Iryna Gurevych\nAbstract: Activation functions can have a significant impact on reducing the topological complexity of input data and therefore improve the performance of the model. Selecting a suitable activation function is an essential step in neural model design. However, the choice of activation function is seldom discussed or explored in Transformer-based language models. Their activation functions are chosen beforehand and then remain fixed from pre-training to fine-tuning. As a result, the inductive biases they imposed on models cannot be adjusted during this long life cycle. Moreover, subsequently developed models (e.g., RoBERTa, BART, and GPT-3) often follow up prior work (e.g., BERT) to use the same activation function without justification. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of using Rational Activation Function (RAF), a learnable activation function, in the Transformer architecture. In contrast to conventional, predefined activation functions, RAFs can adaptively learn optimal activation functions during training according to input data. Our experiments show the RAF-based Transformer (RAFT) achieves a lower validation perplexity than a vanilla BERT with the GELU function. We further evaluate RAFT on downstream tasks in low- and full-data settings. Our results show that RAFT outperforms the counterpart model across the majority of tasks and settings. For instance, RAFT outperforms vanilla BERT on the GLUE benchmark by 5.71 points on average in low-data scenario (where 100 training examples are available) and by 2.05 points on SQuAD in full-data setting. Analysis of the shapes of learned RAFs further unveils that they substantially vary between different layers of the pre-trained model and mostly look very different from conventional activation functions. RAFT opens a new research direction for analyzing and interpreting pre-trained models according to the learned activation functions.", "label": 0}

However, the absence of a unified framework in the present ABSA research makes it challenging to compare different models' performance fairly. Therefore, we created an open-source ABSA framework, namely PYABSA. Besides, previous efforts usually neglect the precursor aspect term extraction (ASC) subtask and focus on the aspect sentiment classification (ATE) subtask. Compared to previous works, PYABSA includes the features of aspect term extraction, aspect sentiment classification, and text classification, while multiple ABSA subtasks can be adapted to PYABSA owing to its modular architecture. To facilitate ABSA applications, PYABSAseamless integrates multilingual modelling, automated dataset annotation, etc., which are helpful in deploying ABSA services. In ASC and ATE, PYABSA provides up to 33 and 7 built-in models, respectively, while all the models provide quick training and instant inference.

However, the lack of attention to the partner makes the model more egocentric: they tend to show their persona by all means such as twisting the topic stiffly, pulling the conversation to their own interests regardless, and rambling their persona with little curiosity to the partner. In this work, we propose COSPLAY(COncept Set guided PersonaLized dialogue generation Across both partY personas) that considers both parties as a \"team\": expressing self-persona while keeping curiosity toward the partner, leading responses around mutual personas, and finding the common ground. Specifically, we first represent self-persona, partner persona and mutual dialogue all in the concept sets. Then, we propose the Concept Set framework with a suite of knowledge-enhanced operations to process them such as set algebras, set expansion, and set distance. Based on these operations as medium, we train the model by utilizing 1) concepts of both party personas, 2) concept relationship between them, and 3) their relationship to the future dialogue. Extensive experiments on a large public dataset, Persona-Chat, demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for generating less egocentric, more human-like, and higher quality responses in both automatic and human evaluations.", "label": 0}

To that end, natural language processing can extract relevant information. Methods based on transfer learning using pre-trained language models have achieved state-of-the-art results in most NLP applications; however, publicly available models lack exposure to speciality-languages, especially in the medical field.   Objective   We aimed to evaluate the impact of adapting a language model to French clinical reports on downstream medical NLP tasks.   Methods   We leveraged a corpus of 21M clinical reports collected from August 2017 to July 2021 at the Greater Paris University Hospitals (APHP) to produce two CamemBERT architectures on speciality language: one retrained from scratch and the other using CamemBERT as its initialisation. We used two French annotated medical datasets to compare our language models to the original CamemBERT network, evaluating the statistical significance of improvement with the Wilcoxon test.   Results   Our models pretrained on clinical reports increased the average F1-score on APMed (an APHP-specific task) by 3 percentage points to 91%, a statistically significant improvement. They also achieved performance comparable to the original CamemBERT on QUAERO. These results hold true for the fine-tuned and from-scratch versions alike, starting from very few pre-training samples.   Conclusions   We confirm previous literature showing that adapting generalist pre-train language models such as CamenBERT on speciality corpora improves their performance for downstream clinical NLP tasks. Our results suggest that retraining from scratch does not induce a statistically significant performance gain compared to fine-tuning.", "label": 0}

For example, we see both suicide and depression-related behavior (multiple contexts) in the text ``I have a gun and feel pretty bad about my life, and it wouldn't be the worst thing if I didn't wake up tomorrow''. Domain specificity in self-attention architectures is handled by fine-tuning on excerpts from relevant domain specific resources (datasets and external knowledge - medical textbook chapters on mental health diagnosis related to suicide and depression). We propose a modified self-attention architecture Knowledge-infused Self Attention Transformer (KSAT) that achieves the integration of multiple domain-specific contexts through the use of external knowledge sources. KSAT introduces knowledge-guided biases in dedicated self-attention layers for each knowledge source to accomplish this. In addition, KSAT provides mechanics for controlling the trade-off between learning from data and learning from knowledge. Our quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that (1) the KSAT architecture provides novel human-understandable ways to precisely measure and visualize the contributions of the infused domain contexts, and (2) KSAT performs competitively with other knowledge-infused baselines and significantly outperforms baselines that use fine-tuning for domain-specific tasks.", "label": 0}

Existing personalized dialogue systems have tried to extract user profiles from dialogue history to guide personalized response generation. Since the dialogue history is usually long and noisy, most existing methods truncate the dialogue history to model the user's personality. Such methods can generate some personalized responses, but a large part of dialogue history is wasted, leading to sub-optimal performance of personalized response generation. In this work, we propose to refine the user dialogue history on a large scale, based on which we can handle more dialogue history and obtain more abundant and accurate persona information. Specifically, we design an MSP model which consists of three personal information refiners and a personalized response generator. With these multi-level refiners, we can sparsely extract the most valuable information (tokens) from the dialogue history and leverage other similar users' data to enhance personalization. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model in generating more informative and personalized responses.", "label": 0}

Wang, Luke Zettlemoyer, Marjan Ghazvininejad\nAbstract: Mined bitexts can contain imperfect translations that yield unreliable training signals for Neural Machine Translation (NMT). While filtering such pairs out is known to improve final model quality, we argue that it is suboptimal in low-resource conditions where even mined data can be limited. In our work, we propose instead, to refine the mined bitexts via automatic editing: given a sentence in a language xf, and a possibly imperfect translation of it xe, our model generates a revised version xf' or xe' that yields a more equivalent translation pair (i.e., <xf, xe'> or <xf', xe>). We use a simple editing strategy by (1) mining potentially imperfect translations for each sentence in a given bitext, (2) learning a model to reconstruct the original translations and translate, in a multi-task fashion. Experiments demonstrate that our approach successfully improves the quality of CCMatrix mined bitext for 5 low-resource language-pairs and 10 translation directions by up to ~ 8 BLEU points, in most cases improving upon a competitive back-translation baseline.", "label": 0}

Historically the SLP task has been broken into two steps; Firstly, translating from a spoken language sentence to a gloss sequence and secondly, producing a sign language video given a sequence of glosses. In this paper we apply Natural Language Processing techniques to the first step of the SLP pipeline. We use language models such as BERT and Word2Vec to create better sentence level embeddings, and apply several tokenization techniques, demonstrating how these improve performance on the low resource translation task of Text to Gloss. We introduce Text to HamNoSys (T2H) translation, and show the advantages of using a phonetic representation for sign language translation rather than a sign level gloss representation. Furthermore, we use HamNoSys to extract the hand shape of a sign and use this as additional supervision during training, further increasing the performance on T2H.

{"text": "Title: PromptCast: A New Prompt-based Learning Paradigm for Time Series Forecasting\nAuthors: Hao Xue, Flora D. Salim\nAbstract: This paper studies the time series forecasting problem from a whole new perspective. In the existing SOTA time-series representation learning methods, the forecasting models take a sequence of numerical values as input and yield numerical values as output. The existing SOTA models are largely based on Transformer architecture, modified with multiple encoding mechanisms to incorporate the context and semantics around the historical data. In this paper, we approach representation learning of time-series from the paradigm of prompt-based natural language modeling. Inspired by the successes of pre-trained language foundation models, we pose a question about whether these models can also be adapted to solve time-series forecasting. Thus, we propose a new forecasting paradigm: prompt-based time series forecasting (PromptCast). In this novel task, the numerical input and output are transformed into prompts. We frame the forecasting task in a sentence-to-sentence manner which makes it possible to directly apply language models for forecasting purposes. To support and facilitate the research of this task, we also present a large-scale dataset (PISA) that includes three real-world forecasting scenarios. We evaluate different SOTA numerical-based forecasting methods and language generation models such as Bart. The benchmark results with single- and multi-step forecasting settings demonstrate that the proposed prompt-based time series forecasting with language generation models is a promising research direction. In addition, in comparison to conventional numerical-based forecasting, PromptCast shows a much better generalization ability under the zero-shot setting. We believe that the proposed PromptCast task as well as our PISA dataset could provide novel insights and further lead to new research directions in the domain of time-series representation learning and forecasting.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: A Continuum of Generation Tasks for Investigating Length Bias and Degenerate Repetition\nAuthors: Darcey Riley, David Chiang\nAbstract: Language models suffer from various degenerate behaviors. These differ between tasks: machine translation (MT) exhibits length bias, while tasks like story generation exhibit excessive repetition. Recent work has attributed the difference to task constrainedness, but evidence for this claim has always involved many confounding variables. To study this question directly, we introduce a new experimental framework that allows us to smoothly vary task constrainedness, from MT at one end to fully open-ended generation at the other, while keeping all other aspects fixed. We find that: (1) repetition decreases smoothly with constrainedness, explaining the difference in repetition across tasks; (2) length bias surprisingly also decreases with constrainedness, suggesting some other cause for the difference in length bias; (3) across the board, these problems affect the mode, not the whole distribution; (4) the differences cannot be attributed to a change in the entropy of the distribution, since another method of changing the entropy, label smoothing, does not produce the same effect.", "label": 0}

However, this approach has high variance across different sets of few shots and across different finetuning runs. For example, we find that validation accuracy on RTE can vary by as much as 27 points. In this context, we make two contributions for more effective few-shot learning. First, we propose novel ensembling methods and show that they substantially reduce variance. Second, since performance depends a lot on the set of few shots selected, active learning is promising for few-shot classification. Based on our stable ensembling method, we build on existing work on active learning and introduce a new criterion: inter-prompt uncertainty sampling with diversity. We present the first active learning based approach to select training examples for prompt-based learning and show that it outperforms prior work on active learning. Finally, we show that our combined method, MEAL (Multiprompt finetuning and prediction Ensembling with Active Learning), improves overall performance of prompt-based finetuning by 2.3 absolute points on five different tasks.", "label": 0}

They have been shown to provide high performances on a variety of tasks but are also prone to shortcut learning and bias. Addressing such incorrect model behavior via parameter adjustments is very costly. This is particularly problematic for updating dynamic concepts, such as moral values, which vary culturally or interpersonally. In this work, we question the current common practice of storing all information in the model parameters and propose the Revision Transformer (RiT) employing information retrieval to facilitate easy model updating. The specific combination of a large-scale pre-trained LM that inherently but also diffusely encodes world knowledge with a clear-structured revision engine makes it possible to update the model's knowledge with little effort and the help of user interaction.

Due to the representation gap between discrete constraints and continuous vectors in NMT models, most existing works choose to construct synthetic data or modify the decoding algorithm to impose lexical constraints, treating the NMT model as a black box. In this work, we propose to open this black box by directly integrating the constraints into NMT models. Specifically, we vectorize source and target constraints into continuous keys and values, which can be utilized by the attention modules of NMT models. The proposed integration method is based on the assumption that the correspondence between keys and values in attention modules is naturally suitable for modeling constraint pairs. Experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms several representative baselines on four language pairs, demonstrating the superiority of integrating vectorized lexical constraints.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: Recurrent Memory Transformer\nAuthors: Aydar Bulatov, Yuri Kuratov, Mikhail S. Burtsev\nAbstract: Transformer-based models show their effectiveness across multiple domains and tasks. The self-attention allows to combine information from all sequence elements into context-aware representations. However, global and local information has to be stored mostly in the same element-wise representations. Moreover, the length of an input sequence is limited by quadratic computational complexity of self-attention.   In this work, we propose and study a memory-augmented segment-level recurrent Transformer (Recurrent Memory Transformer). Memory allows to store and process local and global information as well as to pass information between segments of the long sequence with the help of recurrence. We implement a memory mechanism with no changes to Transformer model by adding special memory tokens to the input or output sequence. Then Transformer is trained to control both memory operations and sequence representations processing.   Results of experiments show that our model performs on par with the Transformer-XL on language modeling for smaller memory sizes and outperforms it for tasks that require longer sequence processing. We show that adding memory tokens to Tr-XL is able to improve it performance. This makes Recurrent Memory Transformer a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.", "label": 0}

These works attempt to leverage knowledge graphs, the de facto standard of symbolic knowledge representation, along with pre-trained LMs. While existing approaches leverage external knowledge, it remains an open question how to jointly incorporate knowledge graphs representing varying contexts, from local (e.g., sentence), to document-level, to global knowledge, to enable knowledge-rich and interpretable exchange across these contexts. Such rich contextualization can be especially beneficial for long document understanding tasks since standard pre-trained LMs are typically bounded by the input sequence length. In light of these challenges, we propose KALM, a Knowledge-Aware Language Model that jointly leverages knowledge in local, document-level, and global contexts for long document understanding. KALM first encodes long documents and knowledge graphs into the three knowledge-aware context representations. It then processes each context with context-specific layers, followed by a context fusion layer that facilitates interpretable knowledge exchange to derive an overarching document representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KALM achieves state-of-the-art performance on three long document understanding tasks across 6 datasets/settings. Further analyses reveal that the three knowledge-aware contexts are complementary and they all contribute to model performance, while the importance and information exchange patterns of different contexts vary with respect to different tasks and datasets.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Language Models as Zero-Shot Planners: Extracting Actionable Knowledge for Embodied Agents\nAuthors: Wenlong Huang, Pieter Abbeel, Deepak Pathak, Igor Mordatch\nAbstract: Can world knowledge learned by large language models (LLMs) be used to act in interactive environments? In this paper, we investigate the possibility of grounding high-level tasks, expressed in natural language (e.g. \"make breakfast\"), to a chosen set of actionable steps (e.g. \"open fridge\"). While prior work focused on learning from explicit step-by-step examples of how to act, we surprisingly find that if pre-trained LMs are large enough and prompted appropriately, they can effectively decompose high-level tasks into mid-level plans without any further training. However, the plans produced naively by LLMs often cannot map precisely to admissible actions. We propose a procedure that conditions on existing demonstrations and semantically translates the plans to admissible actions. Our evaluation in the recent VirtualHome environment shows that the resulting method substantially improves executability over the LLM baseline. The conducted human evaluation reveals a trade-off between executability and correctness but shows a promising sign towards extracting actionable knowledge from language models.

However, in contrast to other information extraction tasks, there is a lack of gold-standard corpora of business process descriptions that are carefully annotated with all the entities and relationships of interest. Due to this, it is currently hard to compare the results obtained by extraction approaches in an objective manner, whereas the lack of annotated texts also prevents the application of data-driven information extraction methodologies, typical of the natural language processing field. Therefore, to bridge this gap, we present the PET dataset, a first corpus of business process descriptions annotated with activities, gateways, actors, and flow information. We present our new resource, including a variety of baselines to benchmark the difficulty and challenges of business process extraction from text.

It is not known whether semi-supervised learning is still helpful when a large-scale language model is also supplemented. This study aims to answer this question by comparing a data-to-text system only supplemented with a language model, to two data-to-text systems that are additionally enriched by a data augmentation or a pseudo-labeling semi-supervised learning approach.   Results show that semi-supervised learning results in higher scores on diversity metrics. In terms of output quality, extending the training set of a data-to-text system with a language model using the pseudo-labeling approach did increase text quality scores, but the data augmentation approach yielded similar scores to the system without training set extension. These results indicate that semi-supervised learning approaches can bolster output quality and diversity, even when a language model is also present.", "label": 0}

Kanhere\nAbstract: Each and every organisation releases information in a variety of forms ranging from annual reports to legal proceedings. Such documents may contain sensitive information and releasing them openly may lead to the leakage of confidential information. Detection of sentences that contain sensitive information in documents can help organisations prevent the leakage of valuable confidential information. This is especially challenging when such sentences contain a substantial amount of information or are paraphrased versions of known sensitive content. Current approaches to sensitive information detection in such complex settings are based on keyword-based approaches or standard machine learning models. In this paper, we wish to explore whether pre-trained transformer models are well suited to detect complex sensitive information. Pre-trained transformers are typically trained on an enormous amount of text and therefore readily learn grammar, structure and other linguistic features, making them particularly attractive for this task. Through our experiments on the Monsanto trial data set, we observe that the fine-tuned Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) transformer model performs better than traditional models. We experimented with four different categories of documents in the Monsanto dataset and observed that BERT achieves better F2 scores by 24.13\\% to 65.79\\% for GHOST, 30.14\\% to 54.88\\% for TOXIC, 39.22\\% for CHEMI, 53.57\\% for REGUL compared to existing sensitive information detection models.", "label": 0}

Existing \"Stereotype Detection\" datasets mainly adopt a diagnostic approach toward large PLMs. Blodgett et. al (2021a) show that there are significant reliability issues with the existing benchmark datasets. Annotating a reliable dataset requires a precise understanding of the subtle nuances of how stereotypes manifest in text. In this paper, we annotate a focused evaluation set for \"Stereotype Detection\" that addresses those pitfalls by de-constructing various ways in which stereotypes manifest in text. Further, we present a multi-task model that leverages the abundance of data-rich neighboring tasks such as hate speech detection, offensive language detection, misogyny detection, etc., to improve the empirical performance on \"Stereotype Detection\". We then propose a reinforcement-learning agent that guides the multi-task learning model by learning to identify the training examples from the neighboring tasks that help the target task the most. We show that the proposed models achieve significant empirical gains over existing baselines on all the tasks.", "label": 0}

This paper evaluates how natural language processing (NLP) can be used to identify the risk of acute care use (ACU) in oncology patients, once chemotherapy starts. Risk prediction using structured health data (SHD) is now standard, but predictions using free-text formats are complex. This paper explores the use of free-text notes for the prediction of ACU instead of SHD. Deep Learning models were compared to manually engineered language features. Results show that SHD models minimally outperform NLP models; an l1-penalised logistic regression with SHD achieved a C-statistic of 0.748 (95%-CI: 0.735, 0.762), while the same model with language features achieved 0.730 (95%-CI: 0.717, 0.745) and a transformer-based model achieved 0.702 (95%-CI: 0.688, 0.717).

Automatic approaches for lay summarisation can provide significant value in broadening access to scientific literature, enabling a greater degree of both interdisciplinary knowledge sharing and public understanding when it comes to research findings. However, current corpora for this task are limited in their size and scope, hindering the development of broadly applicable data-driven approaches.

We refer to these annotations as Non-Textual Units (NTUs). We posit that NTUs provide social context beyond their textual semantics and leveraging these units can enrich social media text representations. In this work we construct an NTU-centric social heterogeneous network to co-embed NTUs. We then principally integrate these NTU embeddings into a large pretrained language model by fine-tuning with these additional units. This adds context to noisy short-text social media. Experiments show that utilizing NTU-augmented text representations significantly outperforms existing text-only baselines by 2-5\\% relative points on many downstream tasks highlighting the importance of context to social media NLP. We also highlight that including NTU context into the initial layers of language model alongside text is better than using it after the text embedding is generated.

{"text": "Title: Learning to Reason With Relational Abstractions\nAuthors: Andrew J. Nam, Mengye Ren, Chelsea Finn, James L. McClelland\nAbstract: Large language models have recently shown promising progress in mathematical reasoning when fine-tuned with human-generated sequences walking through a sequence of solution steps. However, the solution sequences are not formally structured and the resulting model-generated sequences may not reflect the kind of systematic reasoning we might expect an expert human to produce. In this paper, we study how to build stronger reasoning capability in language models using the idea of relational abstractions. We introduce new types of sequences that more explicitly provide an abstract characterization of the transitions through intermediate solution steps to the goal state. We find that models that are supplied with such sequences as prompts can solve tasks with a significantly higher accuracy, and models that are trained to produce such sequences solve problems better than those that are trained with previously used human-generated sequences and other baselines. Our work thus takes several steps toward elucidating and improving how language models perform on tasks requiring multi-step mathematical reasoning.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Expedition: A System for the Unsupervised Learning of a Hierarchy of Concepts\nAuthors: Omid Madani\nAbstract: We present a system for bottom-up cumulative learning of myriad concepts corresponding to meaningful character strings, and their part-related and prediction edges. The learning is self-supervised in that the concepts discovered are used as predictors as well as targets of prediction. We devise an objective for segmenting with the learned concepts, derived from comparing to a baseline prediction system, that promotes making and using larger concepts, which in turn allows for predicting larger spans of text, and we describe a simple technique to promote exploration, i.e. trying out newly generated concepts in the segmentation process. We motivate and explain a layering of the concepts, to help separate the (conditional) distributions learnt among concepts. The layering of the concepts roughly corresponds to a part-whole concept hierarchy. With rudimentary segmentation and learning algorithms, the system is promising in that it acquires many concepts (tens of thousands in our small-scale experiments), and it learns to segment text well: when fed with English text with spaces removed, starting at the character level, much of what is learned respects word or phrase boundaries, and over time the average number of \"bad\" splits within segmentations, i.e. splits inside words, decreases as larger concepts are discovered and the system learns when to use them during segmentation. We report on promising experiments when the input text is converted to binary and the system begins with only two concepts, \"0\" and \"1\". The system is transparent, in the sense that it is easy to tell what the concepts learned correspond to, and which ones are active in a segmentation, or how the system \"sees\" its input. We expect this framework to be extensible and we discuss the current limitations and a number of directions for enhancing the learning and inference capabilities.", "label": 0}

Prior online backdoor defense methods for NLP models only focus on the anomalies at either the input or output level, still suffering from fragility to adaptive attacks and high computational cost. In this work, we take the first step to investigate the unconcealment of textual poisoned samples at the intermediate-feature level and propose a feature-based efficient online defense method. Through extensive experiments on existing attacking methods, we find that the poisoned samples are far away from clean samples in the intermediate feature space of a poisoned NLP model. Motivated by this observation, we devise a distance-based anomaly score (DAN) to distinguish poisoned samples from clean samples at the feature level. Experiments on sentiment analysis and offense detection tasks demonstrate the superiority of DAN, as it substantially surpasses existing online defense methods in terms of defending performance and enjoys lower inference costs. Moreover, we show that DAN is also resistant to adaptive attacks based on feature-level regularization. Our code is available at https://github.com/lancopku/DAN.", "label": 0}

Similarly, developers of such ML-driven systems need to be able to add new training data to an already-existing dataset to support these new skills. In intent classification systems, problems can arise if training data for a new skill's intent overlaps semantically with an already-existing intent. We call such cases collisions. This paper introduces the task of intent collision detection between multiple datasets for the purposes of growing a system's skillset. We introduce several methods for detecting collisions, and evaluate our methods on real datasets that exhibit collisions. To highlight the need for intent collision detection, we show that model performance suffers if new data is added in such a way that does not arbitrate colliding intents. Finally, we use collision detection to construct and benchmark a new dataset, Redwood, which is composed of 451 ntent categories from 13 original intent classification datasets, making it the largest publicly available intent classification benchmark.", "label": 0}

To explore extrapolation to future data points, we further introduce a new data-to-text generation dataset, TempWikiBio, containing more than 4 millions of chronologically ordered revisions of biographical articles from English Wikipedia, each paired with structured personal profiles. Through data-to-text generation on TempWikiBio, text-to-text generation on the content transfer dataset, and summarization on XSum, we show that linear prompts on encoder and textual prompts improve the generation quality on all datasets. Despite having less performance drop when testing on data drawn from a later time, linear prompts focus more on non-temporal information and are less sensitive to the given timestamps, according to human evaluations and sensitivity analyses. Meanwhile, textual prompts establish the association between the given timestamps and the output dates, yielding more factual temporal information in the output.", "label": 0}

Given that informal Persian exhibits particular characteristics, any computational model trained on formal Persian is unlikely to transfer well to informal Persian, necessitating the creation of dedicated treebanks for this variety. We thus detail the development of the open-source Informal Persian Universal Dependency Treebank, a new treebank annotated within the Universal Dependencies scheme. We then investigate the parsing of informal Persian by training two dependency parsers on existing formal treebanks and evaluating them on out-of-domain data, i.e. the development set of our informal treebank. Our results show that parsers experience a substantial performance drop when we move across the two domains, as they face more unknown tokens and structures and fail to generalize well. Furthermore, the dependency relations whose performance deteriorates the most represent the unique properties of the informal variant. The ultimate goal of this study that demonstrates a broader impact is to provide a stepping-stone to reveal the significance of informal variants of languages, which have been widely overlooked in natural language processing tools across languages.", "label": 0}

In such a situation, training data and models are exposed to the public. As a result, attackers can manipulate the training process to inject some triggers into the model, which is called backdoor attack. Backdoor attack is quite stealthy and difficult to be detected because it has little inferior influence on the model's performance for the clean samples. To get a precise grasp and understanding of this problem, in this paper, we conduct a comprehensive review of backdoor attacks and defenses in the field of NLP.

Recent adaptive training methods promote the output of infrequent words by emphasizing their weights in the overall training objectives. Despite the improved recall of low-frequency words, their prediction precision is unexpectedly hindered by the adaptive objectives. Inspired by the observation that low-frequency words form a more compact embedding space, we tackle this challenge from a representation learning perspective. Specifically, we propose a frequency-aware token-level contrastive learning method, in which the hidden state of each decoding step is pushed away from the counterparts of other target words, in a soft contrastive way based on the corresponding word frequencies. We conduct experiments on widely used NIST Chinese-English and WMT14 English-German translation tasks. Empirical results show that our proposed methods can not only significantly improve the translation quality but also enhance lexical diversity and optimize word representation space. Further investigation reveals that, comparing with related adaptive training strategies, the superiority of our method on low-frequency word prediction lies in the robustness of token-level recall across different frequencies without sacrificing precision.", "label": 0}

Building a neural machine translation (NMT) system has become an urgent trend, especially in the low-resource setting.

Hence, in this paper, we focus on research done to alleviate the need for recording gaze behaviour at run time. We also mention different eye tracking corpora in multiple languages, which are currently available and can be used in natural language processing. We conclude our paper by discussing applications in a domain - education - and how learning gaze behaviour can help in solving the tasks of complex word identification and automatic essay grading.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: DPRK-BERT: The Supreme Language Model\nAuthors: Arda Akdemir, Yeojoo Jeon\nAbstract: Deep language models have achieved remarkable success in the NLP domain. The standard way to train a deep language model is to employ unsupervised learning from scratch on a large unlabeled corpus. However, such large corpora are only available for widely-adopted and high-resource languages and domains. This study presents the first deep language model, DPRK-BERT, for the DPRK language. We achieve this by compiling the first unlabeled corpus for the DPRK language and fine-tuning a preexisting the ROK language model. We compare the proposed model with existing approaches and show significant improvements on two DPRK datasets. We also present a cross-lingual version of this model which yields better generalization across the two Korean languages. Finally, we provide various NLP tools related to the DPRK language that would foster future research.", "label": 0}

Yet, it is strikingly vulnerable to adversarial examples, e.g., word substitution attacks using only synonyms can easily fool a BERT-based sentiment analysis model. In this paper, we demonstrate that adversarial training, the prevalent defense technique, does not directly fit a conventional fine-tuning scenario, because it suffers severely from catastrophic forgetting: failing to retain the generic and robust linguistic features that have already been captured by the pre-trained model. In this light, we propose Robust Informative Fine-Tuning (RIFT), a novel adversarial fine-tuning method from an information-theoretical perspective. In particular, RIFT encourages an objective model to retain the features learned from the pre-trained model throughout the entire fine-tuning process, whereas a conventional one only uses the pre-trained weights for initialization. Experimental results show that RIFT consistently outperforms the state-of-the-arts on two popular NLP tasks: sentiment analysis and natural language inference, under different attacks across various pre-trained language models.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Semi-supervised New Event Type Induction and Description via Contrastive Loss-Enforced Batch Attention\nAuthors: Carl Edwards, Heng Ji\nAbstract: Most event extraction methods have traditionally relied on an annotated set of event types. However, creating event ontologies and annotating supervised training data are expensive and time-consuming. Previous work has proposed semi-supervised approaches which leverage seen (annotated) types to learn how to automatically discover new event types. State-of-the-art methods, both semi-supervised or fully unsupervised, use a form of reconstruction loss on specific tokens in a context. In contrast, we present a novel approach to semi-supervised new event type induction using a masked contrastive loss, which learns similarities between event mentions by enforcing an attention mechanism over the data minibatch. We further disentangle the discovered clusters by approximating the underlying manifolds in the data, which allows us to increase normalized mutual information and Fowlkes-Mallows scores by over 20% absolute. Building on these clustering results, we extend our approach to two new tasks: predicting the type name of the discovered clusters and linking them to FrameNet frames.", "label": 0}

Griffiths\nAbstract: For human children as well as machine learning systems, a key challenge in learning a word is linking the word to the visual phenomena it describes. By organizing model output into word categories used to analyze child language learning data, we show a correspondence between word learning in children and the performance of image captioning models. Although captioning models are trained only on standard machine learning data, we find that their performance in producing words from a variety of word categories correlates with the age at which children acquire words from each of those categories. To explain why this correspondence exists, we show that the performance of captioning models is correlated with human judgments of the concreteness of words, suggesting that these models are capturing the complex real-world association between words and visual phenomena.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Embedding Hallucination for Few-Shot Language Fine-tuning\nAuthors: Yiren Jian, Chongyang Gao, Soroush Vosoughi\nAbstract: Few-shot language learners adapt knowledge from a pre-trained model to recognize novel classes from a few-labeled sentences. In such settings, fine-tuning a pre-trained language model can cause severe over-fitting. In this paper, we propose an Embedding Hallucination (EmbedHalluc) method, which generates auxiliary embedding-label pairs to expand the fine-tuning dataset. The hallucinator is trained by playing an adversarial game with the discriminator, such that the hallucinated embedding is indiscriminative to the real ones in the fine-tuning dataset. By training with the extended dataset, the language learner effectively learns from the diverse hallucinated embeddings to overcome the over-fitting issue. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method is effective in a wide range of language tasks, outperforming current fine-tuning methods. Further, we show that EmbedHalluc outperforms other methods that address this over-fitting problem, such as common data augmentation, semi-supervised pseudo-labeling, and regularization. The code will be made available at: https://github.com/yiren-jian/EmbedHalluc.", "label": 0}

Some recent work has started to look at the characteristics of these models, yet many concerns have not been fully addressed. In this work, we conduct a study on emotional corpora to explore a popular self-supervised model -- wav2vec 2.0. Via a set of quantitative analysis, we mainly demonstrate that: 1) wav2vec 2.0 appears to discard paralinguistic information that is less useful for word recognition purposes; 2) for emotion recognition, representations from the middle layer alone perform as well as those derived from layer averaging, while the final layer results in the worst performance in some cases; 3) current self-supervised models may not be the optimal solution for downstream tasks that make use of non-lexical features.

It is regarded as crucial for the development of advanced text generation technologies that are more natural and better meet the specific constraints in practical applications. In recent years, methods using large-scale pre-trained language models (PLMs), in particular the widely used transformer-based PLMs, have become a new paradigm of NLG, allowing generation of more diverse and fluent text. However, due to the lower level of interpretability of deep neural networks, the controllability of these methods need to be guaranteed. To this end, controllable text generation using transformer-based PLMs has become a rapidly growing yet challenging new research hotspot. A diverse range of approaches have emerged in the recent 3-4 years, targeting different CTG tasks which may require different types of controlled constraints. In this paper, we present a systematic critical review on the common tasks, main approaches and evaluation methods in this area. Finally, we discuss the challenges that the field is facing, and put forward various promising future directions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey paper to summarize CTG techniques from the perspective of PLMs. We hope it can help researchers in related fields to quickly track the academic frontier, providing them with a landscape of the area and a roadmap for future research.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: SEE-Few: Seed, Expand and Entail for Few-shot Named Entity Recognition\nAuthors: Zeng Yang, Linhai Zhang, Deyu Zhou\nAbstract: Few-shot named entity recognition (NER) aims at identifying named entities based on only few labeled instances. Current few-shot NER methods focus on leveraging existing datasets in the rich-resource domains which might fail in a training-from-scratch setting where no source-domain data is used. To tackle training-from-scratch setting, it is crucial to make full use of the annotation information (the boundaries and entity types). Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel multi-task (Seed, Expand and Entail) learning framework, SEE-Few, for Few-shot NER without using source domain data. The seeding and expanding modules are responsible for providing as accurate candidate spans as possible for the entailing module. The entailing module reformulates span classification as a textual entailment task, leveraging both the contextual clues and entity type information. All the three modules share the same text encoder and are jointly learned. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets under the training-from-scratch setting show that the proposed method outperformed state-of-the-art few-shot NER methods with a large margin.

For example, individuals who identify as members of the LGBTQIA+ community and/or BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color) are at higher risk for abuse and harassment online. In this work, we first introduce a real-world dataset that will enable us to study and understand harmful online conversational content.

Recent results from psycholinguistics suggest that gender-neutral pronouns (in Swedish) are not associated with human processing difficulties. This, we show, is in sharp contrast with automated processing. We show that gender-neutral pronouns in Danish, English, and Swedish are associated with higher perplexity, more dispersed attention patterns, and worse downstream performance. We argue that such conservativity in language models may limit widespread adoption of gender-neutral pronouns and must therefore be resolved.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Zero-shot Aspect-level Sentiment Classification via Explicit Utilization of Aspect-to-Document Sentiment Composition\nAuthors: Pengfei Deng, Jianhua Yuan, Yanyan Zhao, Bing Qin\nAbstract: As aspect-level sentiment labels are expensive and labor-intensive to acquire, zero-shot aspect-level sentiment classification is proposed to learn classifiers applicable to new domains without using any annotated aspect-level data. In contrast, document-level sentiment data with ratings are more easily accessible. In this work, we achieve zero-shot aspect-level sentiment classification by only using document-level reviews. Our key intuition is that the sentiment representation of a document is composed of the sentiment representations of all the aspects of that document. Based on this, we propose the AF-DSC method to explicitly model such sentiment composition in reviews. AF-DSC first learns sentiment representations for all potential aspects and then aggregates aspect-level sentiments into a document-level one to perform document-level sentiment classification. In this way, we obtain the aspect-level sentiment classifier as the by-product of the document-level sentiment classifier. Experimental results on aspect-level sentiment classification benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of explicit utilization of sentiment composition in document-level sentiment classification. Our model with only 30k training data outperforms previous work utilizing millions of data.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: High Recall Data-to-text Generation with Progressive Edit\nAuthors: Choonghan Kim, Gary Geunbae Lee\nAbstract: Data-to-text (D2T) generation is the task of generating texts from structured inputs. We observed that when the same target sentence was repeated twice, Transformer (T5) based model generates an output made up of asymmetric sentences from structured inputs. In other words, these sentences were different in length and quality. We call this phenomenon \"Asymmetric Generation\" and we exploit this in D2T generation. Once asymmetric sentences are generated, we add the first part of the output with a no-repeated-target. As this goes through progressive edit (ProEdit), the recall increases. Hence, this method better covers structured inputs than before editing. ProEdit is a simple but effective way to improve performance in D2T generation and it achieves the new stateof-the-art result on the ToTTo dataset", "label": 0}

In this paper, we introduce WikiDes, a novel dataset to generate short descriptions of Wikipedia articles for the problem of text summarization. The dataset consists of over 80k English samples on 6987 topics. We set up a two-phase summarization method - description generation (Phase I) and candidate ranking (Phase II) - as a strong approach that relies on transfer and contrastive learning. For description generation, T5 and BART show their superiority compared to other small-scale pre-trained models. By applying contrastive learning with the diverse input from beam search, the metric fusion-based ranking models outperform the direct description generation models significantly up to 22 ROUGE in topic-exclusive split and topic-independent split. Furthermore, the outcome descriptions in Phase II are supported by human evaluation in over 45.33% chosen compared to 23.66% in Phase I against the gold descriptions. In the aspect of sentiment analysis, the generated descriptions cannot effectively capture all sentiment polarities from paragraphs while doing this task better from the gold descriptions. The automatic generation of new descriptions reduces the human efforts in creating them and enriches Wikidata-based knowledge graphs. Our paper shows a practical impact on Wikipedia and Wikidata since there are thousands of missing descriptions. Finally, we expect WikiDes to be a useful dataset for related works in capturing salient information from short paragraphs.

A significant subset of these approaches incorporate differentially private mechanisms to perturb word embeddings, thus replacing individual words in a sentence. While these methods represent very important contributions, have various advantages over other techniques and do show anonymization capabilities, they have several shortcomings. In this paper, we investigate these weaknesses and demonstrate significant mathematical constraints diminishing the theoretical privacy guarantee as well as major practical shortcomings with regard to the protection against deanonymization attacks, the preservation of content of the original sentences as well as the quality of the language output. Finally, we propose a new method for text anonymization based on transformer based language models fine-tuned for paraphrasing that circumvents most of the identified weaknesses and also offers a formal privacy guarantee. We evaluate the performance of our method via thorough experimentation and demonstrate superior performance over the discussed mechanisms.", "label": 0}

However, fake utterances are mostly generated by altering timbre, prosody, linguistic content or channel noise of original audios. They ignore a fake situation, in which the attacker manipulates an acoustic scene of the original audio with another forgery one. It will pose a major threat to our society if some people misuse the manipulated audio with malicious purpose. Therefore, this motivates us to fill in the gap. This paper designs such a dataset for scene fake audio detection (SceneFake). A manipulated audio in the SceneFake dataset involves only tampering the acoustic scene of an utterance by using speech enhancement technologies. We can not only detect fake utterances on a seen test set but also evaluate the generalization of fake detection models to unseen manipulation attacks. Some benchmark results are described on the SceneFake dataset. Besides, an analysis of fake attacks with different speech enhancement technologies and signal-to-noise ratios are presented on the dataset. The results show that scene manipulated utterances can not be detected reliably by the existing baseline models of ASVspoof 2019. Furthermore, the detection of unseen scene manipulation audio is still challenging.", "label": 0}

However, the existing FP16 or INT8 quantization methods are too complicated, and improper usage will lead to performance damage greatly. In this paper, we develop a toolkit for users to easily quantize their models for inference, in which a Self-Adaptive Mixed-Precision (SAMP) is proposed to automatically control quantization rate by a mixed-precision architecture to balance efficiency and performance. Experimental results show that our SAMP toolkit has a higher speedup than PyTorch and FasterTransformer while ensuring the required performance. In addition, SAMP is based on a modular design, decoupling the tokenizer, embedding, encoder and target layers, which allows users to handle various downstream tasks and can be seamlessly integrated into PyTorch.", "label": 0}

Logan IV, Pete Walsh, Akshita Bhagia, Dirk Groeneveld, Sameer Singh, Iz Beltagy\nAbstract: Recently introduced language model prompting methods can achieve high accuracy in zero- and few-shot settings while requiring few to no learned task-specific parameters. Nevertheless, these methods still often trail behind full model finetuning. In this work, we investigate if a dedicated continued pretraining stage could improve \"promptability\", i.e., zero-shot performance with natural language prompts or few-shot performance with prompt tuning. We reveal settings where existing continued pretraining methods lack promptability. We also identify current methodological gaps, which we fill with thorough large-scale experiments. We demonstrate that a simple recipe, continued pretraining that incorporates a trainable prompt during multi-task learning, leads to improved promptability in both zero- and few-shot settings compared to existing methods, up to 31% relative. On the other hand, we find that continued pretraining using MAML-style meta-learning, a method that directly optimizes few-shot promptability, yields subpar performance. We validate our findings with two prompt tuning methods, and, based on our results, we provide concrete recommendations to optimize promptability for different use cases.", "label": 0}

In this paper, we introduce DICE, a robust and data-efficient generative model for clinical event extraction. DICE frames event extraction as a conditional generation problem and utilizes descriptions provided by domain experts to boost the performance under low-resource settings. Furthermore, DICE learns to locate and bound biomedical mentions with an auxiliary mention identification task trained jointly with event extraction tasks to leverage inter-task dependencies and further incorporates the identified mentions as trigger and argument candidates for their respective tasks. We also introduce MACCROBAT-EE, the first clinical event extraction dataset with event argument annotation.

Danforth, Peter Sheridan Dodds\nAbstract: While recent studies have focused on quantifying word usage to find the overall shapes of narrative emotional arcs, certain features of narratives within narratives remain to be explored. Here, we characterize the narrative time scale of sub-narratives by finding the length of text at which fluctuations in word usage begin to be relevant. We represent more than 30,000 Project Gutenberg books as time series using ousiometrics, a power-danger framework for essential meaning, itself a reinterpretation of the valence-arousal-dominance framework derived from semantic differentials. We decompose each book's power and danger time series using empirical mode decomposition into a sum of constituent oscillatory modes and a non-oscillatory trend. By comparing the decomposition of the original power and danger time series with those derived from shuffled text, we find that shorter books exhibit only a general trend, while longer books have fluctuations in addition to the general trend, similar to how subplots have arcs within an overall narrative arc. These fluctuations typically have a period of a few thousand words regardless of the book length or library classification code, but vary depending on the content and structure of the book. Our method provides a data-driven denoising approach that works for text of various lengths, in contrast to the more traditional approach of using large window sizes that may inadvertently smooth out relevant information, especially for shorter texts.", "label": 0}

However, despite the many datasets and resources built as part of this effort, the majority have small-scale annotations and limited scope, which is insufficient to solve general decomposition tasks. In this paper, we look at large-scale intermediate pre-training of decomposition-based transformers using distant supervision from comparable texts, particularly large-scale parallel news. We show that with such intermediate pre-training, developing robust decomposition-based models for a diverse range of tasks becomes more feasible. For example, on semantic parsing, our model, DecompT5, improves 20% to 30% on two datasets, Overnight and TORQUE, over the baseline language model. We further use DecompT5 to build a novel decomposition-based QA system named DecompEntail, improving over state-of-the-art models, including GPT-3, on both HotpotQA and StrategyQA by 8% and 4%, respectively.", "label": 0}

State-of-the-art approaches rely on sparse experience replay as the primary approach to prevent forgetting.

In this paper, we investigate how relevant the selective memory population is in the lifelong learning process of text classification and question-answering tasks.

Automatic metrics have reported flaws when applied to measure quality aspects of generated text and have been shown to correlate poorly with human judgements. However, human evaluation is time and cost-intensive, and we lack consensus on designing and conducting human evaluation experiments. Thus there is a need for streamlined approaches for efficient collection of human judgements when evaluating natural language generation systems. Therefore, we present a dynamic approach to measure the required number of human annotations when evaluating generated outputs in relative comparison settings. We propose an agent-based framework of human evaluation to assess multiple labelling strategies and methods to decide the better model in a simulation and a crowdsourcing case study. The main results indicate that a decision about the superior model can be made with high probability across different labelling strategies, where assigning a single random worker per task requires the least overall labelling effort and thus the least cost.", "label": 0}

We incorporate reinforcement learning with a dedicatedly designed critic network for reward judgement. Experimental results from both automatic and human evaluation demonstrate a) Our framework is capable of generating relevant, informative and coherent partner personas, even compared to the ground truth partner personas. b) Generated partner personas enhance the succeeding response generation, thus surpassing our baselines and comparison model when partner personas are missing during the inference stage. c) Our framework generates responses that are more informative and engaging than our baseline conditioned on the ground truth partner personas during inference. d) Our dedicatedly designed critic network reinforces our framework effectively. Finally, our framework gives better explainability and reduces the demands for external databases for partner personas.", "label": 0}

Complementing the omitted information using a computer is helpful in providing writing support. Recently, in the field of story understanding and generation, story completion (SC) was proposed to generate the missing parts of an incomplete story. Although its applicability is limited because it requires that the user have prior knowledge of the missing part of a story, missing position prediction (MPP) can be used to compensate for this problem. MPP aims to predict the position of the missing part, but the prerequisite knowledge that \"one sentence is missing\" is still required. In this study, we propose Variable Number MPP (VN-MPP), a new MPP task that removes this restriction; that is, the task to predict multiple missing sentences or to judge whether there are no missing sentences in the first place. We also propose two methods for this new MPP task. Furthermore, based on the novel task and methods, we developed a creative writing support system, COMPASS. The results of a user experiment involving professional creators who write texts in Japanese confirm the efficacy and utility of the developed system.", "label": 0}

Frank, Mirjam Ernestus, Odette Scharenborg\nAbstract: Background: Computational models of speech recognition often assume that the set of target words is already given. This implies that these models do not learn to recognise speech from scratch without prior knowledge and explicit supervision. Visually grounded speech models learn to recognise speech without prior knowledge by exploiting statistical dependencies between spoken and visual input. While it has previously been shown that visually grounded speech models learn to recognise the presence of words in the input, we explicitly investigate such a model as a model of human speech recognition.   Methods: We investigate the time-course of word recognition as simulated by the model using a gating paradigm to test whether its recognition is affected by well-known word-competition effects in human speech processing. We furthermore investigate whether vector quantisation, a technique for discrete representation learning, aids the model in the discovery and recognition of words.   Results/Conclusion: Our experiments show that the model is able to recognise nouns in isolation and even learns to properly differentiate between plural and singular nouns. We also find that recognition is influenced by word competition from the word-initial cohort and neighbourhood density, mirroring word competition effects in human speech comprehension. Lastly, we find no evidence that vector quantisation is helpful in discovering and recognising words.

It greatly facilitates the applications of natural language processing on low-resource languages. However, there are still some languages that the current multilingual models do not perform well on. In this paper, we propose CINO (Chinese Minority Pre-trained Language Model), a multilingual pre-trained language model for Chinese minority languages. It covers Standard Chinese, Yue Chinese, and six other ethnic minority languages. To evaluate the cross-lingual ability of the multilingual model on ethnic minority languages, we collect documents from Wikipedia and news websites, and construct two text classification datasets, WCM (Wiki-Chinese-Minority) and CMNews (Chinese-Minority-News). We show that CINO notably outperforms the baselines on various classification tasks. The CINO model and the datasets are publicly available at http://cino.hfl-rc.com.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Achieving Conversational Goals with Unsupervised Post-hoc Knowledge Injection\nAuthors: Bodhisattwa Prasad Majumder, Harsh Jhamtani, Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick, Julian McAuley\nAbstract: A limitation of current neural dialog models is that they tend to suffer from a lack of specificity and informativeness in generated responses, primarily due to dependence on training data that covers a limited variety of scenarios and conveys limited knowledge. One way to alleviate this issue is to extract relevant knowledge from external sources at decoding time and incorporate it into the dialog response. In this paper, we propose a post-hoc knowledge-injection technique where we first retrieve a diverse set of relevant knowledge snippets conditioned on both the dialog history and an initial response from an existing dialog model. We construct multiple candidate responses, individually injecting each retrieved snippet into the initial response using a gradient-based decoding method, and then select the final response with an unsupervised ranking step. Our experiments in goal-oriented and knowledge-grounded dialog settings demonstrate that human annotators judge the outputs from the proposed method to be more engaging and informative compared to responses from prior dialog systems. We further show that knowledge-augmentation promotes success in achieving conversational goals in both experimental settings.", "label": 0}

We hypothesize that enriching models with speaker information in a controlled, educated way can guide them to pick up on relevant inductive biases. For the speaker-driven task of predicting code-switching points in English--Spanish bilingual dialogues, we show that adding sociolinguistically-grounded speaker features as prepended prompts significantly improves accuracy. We find that by adding influential phrases to the input, speaker-informed models learn useful and explainable linguistic information. To our knowledge, we are the first to incorporate speaker characteristics in a neural model for code-switching, and more generally, take a step towards developing transparent, personalized models that use speaker information in a controlled way.", "label": 0}

Typical GNNs and their variants follow a message-passing manner that obtains network representations by the feature propagation process along network topology, which however ignore the rich textual semantics (e.g., local word-sequence) that exist in many real-world networks. Existing methods for text-rich networks integrate textual semantics by mainly utilizing internal information such as topics or phrases/words, which often suffer from an inability to comprehensively mine the text semantics, limiting the reciprocal guidance between network structure and text semantics. To address these problems, we propose a novel text-rich graph neural network with external knowledge (TeKo), in order to take full advantage of both structural and textual information within text-rich networks. Specifically, we first present a flexible heterogeneous semantic network that incorporates high-quality entities and interactions among documents and entities. We then introduce two types of external knowledge, that is, structured triplets and unstructured entity description, to gain a deeper insight into textual semantics. We further design a reciprocal convolutional mechanism for the constructed heterogeneous semantic network, enabling network structure and textual semantics to collaboratively enhance each other and learn high-level network representations. Extensive experimental results on four public text-rich networks as well as a large-scale e-commerce searching dataset illustrate the superior performance of TeKo over state-of-the-art baselines.", "label": 0}

However, owing to the lack of datasets for different complexities, the definitions produced by models tend to keep the same complexity level. This paper proposes a novel task of generating definitions for a word with controllable complexity levels. Correspondingly, we introduce COMPILING, a dataset given detailed information about Chinese definitions, and each definition is labeled with its complexity levels. The COMPILING dataset includes 74,303 words and 106,882 definitions. To the best of our knowledge, it is the largest dataset of the Chinese definition generation task. We select various representative generation methods as baselines for this task and conduct evaluations, which illustrates that our dataset plays an outstanding role in assisting models in generating different complexity-level definitions.

Recent progress with massively multilingual pretrained models has proven surprisingly effective at performing zero-shot transfer to a wide variety of languages. However, this transfer is not universal, with many languages not currently understood by multilingual approaches. It is estimated that only 72 languages possess a \"small set of labeled datasets\" on which we could test a model's performance, the vast majority of languages not having the resources available to simply evaluate performances on. In this work, we attempt to clarify which languages do and do not currently benefit from such transfer. To that end, we develop a general approach that requires only unlabelled text to detect which languages are not well understood by a cross-lingual model. Our approach is derived from the hypothesis that if a model's understanding is insensitive to perturbations to text in a language, it is likely to have a limited understanding of that language. We construct a cross-lingual sentence similarity task to evaluate our approach empirically on 350, primarily low-resource, languages.", "label": 0}

However, it is challenging to fuse dialogue history and topic information from various sources at the same time in current dialogue generation models because of the input length limit of pre-trained language models (PLMs). In order to expand the information that PLMs can utilize, we encode topic and dialogue history information using certain prompts with multiple channels of Fusion-in-Decoder (FiD) and explore the influence of three different channel settings. In this paper, our experiments focus on a specific Chinese dataset named NaturalConv, where the conversation revolves around a piece of recent news. We thoroughly compared different dialogue models and different FiD channel settings. Empirical results show that by combining our proposed whole passage channel with additional history channel, our methods can achieve competitive performance on NaturalConv, making it possible to encode various information from excessively long texts.", "label": 0}

The proposed approach contains a regressor model which is trained to predict a vector of continuous values in dimensional representation for given speech audio. The output of this model can be interpreted as an emotional category using a mapping algorithm.

Several softwares, have been developed and are available in the field of computational linguistics. Such tools play a crucial role in making classical language texts easily accessible. Some Indian philosophical schools have contributed towards various techniques of verbal cognition to analyze sentences correctly. These theories can be used to build computational tools for word sense disambiguation (WSD). In the absence of WSD, one cannot have proper verbal cognition. These theories considered the concept of 'Yogyat\\=a' (congruity or compatibility) as the indispensable cause of verbal cognition. In this work, we come up with some insights on the basis of these theories to create a tool that will capture Yogyat\\=a of words. We describe the problem of ambiguity in a text and present a method to resolve it computationally with the help of Yogyat\\=a. Here, only two major schools i.e. Ny\\=aya and Vy\\=akarana are considered. Our paper attempts to show the implication of the creation of our tool in this area. Also, our tool involves the creation of an 'ontological tag-set' as well as strategies to mark up the lexicon. The introductory description of ablation is also covered in this paper.

However, fundamental challenges such as error propagation from the automatic speech recognition system still remain. To mitigate these problems, recently, people turn their attention to direct data and propose various joint training methods. In this work, we seek to answer the question of whether joint training really helps cascaded speech translation. We review recent papers on the topic and also investigate a joint training criterion by marginalizing the transcription posterior probabilities. Our findings show that a strong cascaded baseline can diminish any improvements obtained using joint training, and we suggest alternatives to joint training. We hope this work can serve as a refresher of the current speech translation landscape, and motivate research in finding more efficient and creative ways to utilize the direct data for speech translation.", "label": 0}

However, such learning, particularly in Markov-based query rewriting systems have far from addressed the impact of these models on future training where successive feedback is inevitably contingent on the rewrite itself, especially in a continually updating environment. In this paper, we explore the consequences of this inherent lack of self-awareness towards impairing the model performance, ultimately resulting in both Type I and II errors over time. To that end, we propose augmenting the Markov Graph construction with a superposition-based adjacency matrix. Here, our method leverages an induced stochasticity to reactively learn a locally-adaptive decision boundary based on the performance of the individual rewrites in a bi-variate beta setting. We also surface a data augmentation strategy that leverages template-based generation in abridging complex conversation hierarchies of dialogs so as to simplify the learning process. All in all, we demonstrate that our self-aware model improves the overall PR-AUC by 27.45%, achieves a relative defect reduction of up to 31.22%, and is able to adapt quicker to changes in global preferences across a large number of customers.", "label": 0}

We use reinforcement learning from human feedback to train our models with two new additions to help human raters judge agent behaviour. First, to make our agent more helpful and harmless, we break down the requirements for good dialogue into natural language rules the agent should follow, and ask raters about each rule separately. We demonstrate that this breakdown enables us to collect more targeted human judgements of agent behaviour and allows for more efficient rule-conditional reward models. Second, our agent provides evidence from sources supporting factual claims when collecting preference judgements over model statements. For factual questions, evidence provided by Sparrow supports the sampled response 78% of the time. Sparrow is preferred more often than baselines while being more resilient to adversarial probing by humans, violating our rules only 8% of the time when probed. Finally, we conduct extensive analyses showing that though our model learns to follow our rules it can exhibit distributional biases.", "label": 0}

Retrieval is typically performed over a large textual knowledge base (KB) which requires significant memory and compute resources, especially when scaled up. On HotpotQA we systematically investigate reducing the size of the KB index by means of dimensionality (sparse random projections, PCA, autoencoders) and numerical precision reduction.   Our results show that PCA is an easy solution that requires very little data and is only slightly worse than autoencoders, which are less stable. All methods are sensitive to pre- and post-processing and data should always be centered and normalized both before and after dimension reduction. Finally, we show that it is possible to combine PCA with using 1bit per dimension. Overall we achieve (1) 100$\\times$ compression with 75%, and (2) 24$\\times$ compression with 92% original retrieval performance.", "label": 0}

Regrettably, it faces low inference efficiency due to heavy attention layers. Recently, two-stream methods like CLIP and ALIGN with high inference efficiency have also shown promising performance, however, they only consider instance-level alignment between the two streams (thus there is still room for improvement). To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel COllaborative Two-Stream vision-language pretraining model termed COTS for image-text retrieval by enhancing cross-modal interaction. In addition to instance level alignment via momentum contrastive learning, we leverage two extra levels of cross-modal interactions in our COTS: (1) Token-level interaction - a masked visionlanguage modeling (MVLM) learning objective is devised without using a cross-stream network module, where variational autoencoder is imposed on the visual encoder to generate visual tokens for each image. (2) Task-level interaction - a KL-alignment learning objective is devised between text-to-image and image-to-text retrieval tasks, where the probability distribution per task is computed with the negative queues in momentum contrastive learning. Under a fair comparison setting, our COTS achieves the highest performance among all two-stream methods and comparable performance (but with 10,800X faster in inference) w.r.t. the latest single-stream methods. Importantly, our COTS is also applicable to text-to-video retrieval, yielding new state-ofthe-art on the widely-used MSR-VTT dataset.", "label": 0}

Previous studies indicate that multimodal cues can facilitate this challenging task. However, due to the paucity of public multimodal datasets, current methods are mostly limited to either utilizing unimodal features or simplistic multimodal ensemble models. Besides, the inherent class imbalance in real scenario, e.g. sentence ending with short pause will be mostly regarded as the end of turn, also poses great challenge to the turn-taking decision. In this paper, we first collect a large-scale annotated corpus for turn-taking with over 5,000 real human-robot dialogues in speech and text modalities. Then, a novel gated multimodal fusion mechanism is devised to utilize various information seamlessly for turn-taking prediction. More importantly, to tackle the data imbalance issue, we design a simple yet effective data augmentation method to construct negative instances without supervision and apply contrastive learning to obtain better feature representations. Extensive experiments are conducted and the results demonstrate the superiority and competitiveness of our model over several state-of-the-art baselines.", "label": 0}

Chen, Laurel Orr, Neel Guha, Kush Bhatia, Ines Chami, Frederic Sala, Christopher R\u00e9\nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) transfer well to new tasks out-of-the-box simply given a natural language prompt that demonstrates how to perform the task and no additional training. Prompting is a brittle process wherein small modifications to the prompt can cause large variations in the model predictions, and therefore significant effort is dedicated towards designing a painstakingly \"perfect prompt\" for a task. To mitigate the high degree of effort involved in prompt-design, we instead ask whether producing multiple effective, yet imperfect, prompts and aggregating them can lead to a high quality prompting strategy. Our observations motivate our proposed prompting method, ASK ME ANYTHING (AMA). We first develop an understanding of the effective prompt formats, finding that question-answering (QA) prompts, which encourage open-ended generation (\"Who went to the park?\") tend to outperform those that restrict the model outputs (\"John went to the park. Output True or False.\"). Our approach recursively uses the LLM itself to transform task inputs to the effective QA format. We apply the collected prompts to obtain several noisy votes for the input's true label. We find that the prompts can have very different accuracies and complex dependencies and thus propose to use weak supervision, a procedure for combining the noisy predictions, to produce the final predictions for the inputs. We evaluate AMA across open-source model families (e.g., EleutherAI, BLOOM, OPT, and T0) and model sizes (125M-175B parameters), demonstrating an average performance lift of 10.2% over the few-shot baseline. This simple strategy enables the open-source GPT-J-6B model to match and exceed the performance of few-shot GPT3-175B on 15 of 20 popular benchmarks. Averaged across these tasks, the GPT-J-6B model outperforms few-shot GPT3-175B. We release our code here: https://github.com/HazyResearch/ama_prompting", "label": 0}

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the necessity of online assessment for preschool children. One of the areas that should be tested is their ability to speak. Employing an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system would not help since they are pre-trained on voices that differ from children's in terms of frequency and amplitude. Because most of these are pre-trained with data in a specific range of amplitude, their objectives do not make them ready for voices in different amplitudes. To overcome this issue, we added a new objective to the masking objective of the Wav2Vec 2.0 model called Random Frequency Pitch (RFP). In addition, we used our newly introduced dataset to fine-tune our model for Meaningless Words (MW) and Rapid Automatic Naming (RAN) tests. Using masking in concatenation with RFP outperforms the masking objective of Wav2Vec 2.0 by reaching a Word Error Rate (WER) of 1.35. Our new approach reaches a WER of 6.45 on the Persian section of the CommonVoice dataset. Furthermore, our novel methodology produces positive outcomes in zero- and few-shot scenarios.", "label": 0}

Experiments on two benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Thanks to the transferable latent structure, our model is able to yield better dialogue responses than four strong baselines in terms of both automatic and human evaluations, and our model with about 22% parameters particularly delivers a 5x speedup in running time compared with the strongest baseline.

Wonderful merchandise advertisements often attract more people to buy. These advertisements properly integrate multimodal multi-structured information of commodities, such as visual spatial information and fine-grained structure information. However, traditional multimodal text generation focuses on the conventional description of what existed and happened, which does not match the requirement of advertisement copywriting in the real world. Because advertisement copywriting has a vivid language style and higher requirements of faithfulness. Unfortunately, there is a lack of reusable evaluation frameworks and a scarcity of datasets. Therefore, we present a dataset, E-MMAD (e-commercial multimodal multi-structured advertisement copywriting), which requires, and supports much more detailed information in text generation. Noticeably, it is one of the largest video captioning datasets in this field. Accordingly, we propose a baseline method and faithfulness evaluation metric on the strength of structured information reasoning to solve the demand in reality on this dataset.

Reddi, Ke Ye, Felix Chern, Felix Yu, Ruiqi Guo, Sanjiv Kumar\nAbstract: This paper studies the curious phenomenon for machine learning models with Transformer architectures that their activation maps are sparse. By activation map we refer to the intermediate output of the multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) after a ReLU activation function, and by \"sparse\" we mean that on average very few entries (e.g., 3.0% for T5-Base and 6.3% for ViT-B16) are nonzero for each input to MLP. Moreover, larger Transformers with more layers and wider MLP hidden dimensions are sparser as measured by the percentage of nonzero entries. Through extensive experiments we demonstrate that the emergence of sparsity is a prevalent phenomenon that occurs for both natural language processing and vision tasks, on both training and evaluation data, for Transformers of various configurations, at layers of all depth levels, as well as for other architectures including MLP-mixers and 2-layer MLPs. We show that sparsity also emerges using training datasets with random labels, or with random inputs, or with infinite amount of data, demonstrating that sparsity is not a result of a specific family of datasets. We discuss how sparsity immediately implies a way to significantly reduce the FLOP count and improve efficiency for Transformers. Moreover, we demonstrate perhaps surprisingly that enforcing an even sparser activation via Top-k thresholding with a small value of k brings a collection of desired but missing properties for Transformers, namely less sensitivity to noisy training data, more robustness to input corruptions, and better calibration for their prediction confidence.", "label": 0}

The first perspective is to extract genuinely based on contextual description. To achieve this, we propose to conduct counterfactual analysis to attenuate the effects of two significant types of training biases: the event trigger bias and the frequent label bias. We also add tense information into event representations to explicitly place an emphasis on the contextual description. The second perspective is to provide proper uncertainty estimation and abstain from extraction when no relation is described in the text. By parameterization of Dirichlet Prior over the model-predicted categorical distribution, we improve the model estimates of the correctness likelihood and make TempRel predictions more selective. We also employ temperature scaling to recalibrate the model confidence measure after bias mitigation. Through experimental analysis on MATRES, MATRES-DS, and TDDiscourse, we demonstrate that our model extracts TempRel and timelines more faithfully compared to SOTA methods, especially under distribution shifts.", "label": 0}

To reduce the human effort of writing rules, previous researchers adopt an iterative approach to automatically learn logical rules from several seed rules. However, obtaining more seed rules can only be accomplished by extra human annotation with heavy costs. Limited by the size and quality of the seed rules, the model performance of previous systems is bounded. In this paper, we develop a novel framework STREAM to distill task-specific logical rules from large pre-trained models. Specifically, we borrow recent prompt-based language models as the knowledge expert to yield initial seed rules, and based on the formed high-quality instance pool that acts as an intermediary role, we keep teaching the expert to fit our task and learning task-specific logical rules. Experiments on three public named entity tagging benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. With several predefined prompt templates, our system has gained significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods.", "label": 0}

However, they ignore grounding on the supporting facts of each reasoning step, which tends to generate inaccurate decompositions. In this paper, we propose an interpretable stepwise reasoning framework to incorporate both single-hop supporting sentence identification and single-hop question generation at each intermediate step, and utilize the inference of the current hop for the next until reasoning out the final result. We employ a unified reader model for both intermediate hop reasoning and final hop inference and adopt joint optimization for more accurate and robust multi-hop reasoning. We conduct experiments on two benchmark datasets HotpotQA and 2WikiMultiHopQA. The results show that our method can effectively boost performance and also yields a better interpretable reasoning process without decomposition supervision.", "label": 0}

However, most existing end-to-end ASR methods neglect the use of specific language characteristics. For Mandarin Chinese ASR tasks, there exist mutual promotion relationship between Pinyin and Character where Chinese characters can be romanized by Pinyin. Based on the above intuition, we first investigate types of end-to-end encoder-decoder based models in the single-input dual-output (SIDO) multi-task framework, after which a novel asynchronous decoding with fuzzy Pinyin sampling method is proposed according to the one-to-one correspondence characteristics between Pinyin and Character. Furthermore, we proposed a two-stage training strategy to make training more stable and converge faster. The results on the test sets of AISHELL-1 dataset show that the proposed enhanced dual-decoder model without a language model is improved by a big margin compared to strong baseline models.", "label": 0}

Short text messages are increasingly used for communication, especially over social media platforms such as Twitter. Due to insufficient or missing context, unidentified sarcasm in these messages can invert the meaning of a statement, leading to confusion and communication failures. This paper covers a variety of current methods used for sarcasm detection, including detection by context, posting history and machine learning models. Additionally, a shift towards deep learning methods is observable, likely due to the benefit of using a model with induced instead of discrete features combined with the innovation of transformers.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: Hate-CLIPper: Multimodal Hateful Meme Classification based on Cross-modal Interaction of CLIP Features\nAuthors: Gokul Karthik Kumar, Karthik Nandakumar\nAbstract: Hateful memes are a growing menace on social media. While the image and its corresponding text in a meme are related, they do not necessarily convey the same meaning when viewed individually. Hence, detecting hateful memes requires careful consideration of both visual and textual information. Multimodal pre-training can be beneficial for this task because it effectively captures the relationship between the image and the text by representing them in a similar feature space. Furthermore, it is essential to model the interactions between the image and text features through intermediate fusion. Most existing methods either employ multimodal pre-training or intermediate fusion, but not both. In this work, we propose the Hate-CLIPper architecture, which explicitly models the cross-modal interactions between the image and text representations obtained using Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) encoders via a feature interaction matrix (FIM). A simple classifier based on the FIM representation is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Hateful Memes Challenge (HMC) dataset with an AUROC of 85.8, which even surpasses the human performance of 82.65. Experiments on other meme datasets such as Propaganda Memes and TamilMemes also demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed approach. Finally, we analyze the interpretability of the FIM representation and show that cross-modal interactions can indeed facilitate the learning of meaningful concepts. The code for this work is available at https://github.com/gokulkarthik/hateclipper.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: LEATHER: A Framework for Learning to Generate Human-like Text in Dialogue\nAuthors: Anthony Sicilia, Malihe Alikhani\nAbstract: Algorithms for text-generation in dialogue can be misguided. For example, in task-oriented settings, reinforcement learning that optimizes only task-success can lead to abysmal lexical diversity. We hypothesize this is due to poor theoretical understanding of the objectives in text-generation and their relation to the learning process (i.e., model training). To this end, we propose a new theoretical framework for learning to generate text in dialogue. Compared to existing theories of learning, our framework allows for analysis of the multi-faceted goals inherent to text-generation. We use our framework to develop theoretical guarantees for learners that adapt to unseen data. As an example, we apply our theory to study data-shift within a cooperative learning algorithm proposed for the GuessWhat?! visual dialogue game. From this insight, we propose a new algorithm, and empirically, we demonstrate our proposal improves both task-success and human-likeness of the generated text. Finally, we show statistics from our theory are empirically predictive of multiple qualities of the generated dialogue, suggesting our theory is useful for model-selection when human evaluations are not available.", "label": 0}

We incorporate global measures of isomorphism directly into the Skip-gram loss function, successfully increasing the relative isomorphism of trained word embedding spaces and improving their ability to be mapped to a shared cross-lingual space.

The most effective techniques which are used to address such task are in the fields of natural language processing and semantic expansion of terms. Such systems are aimed at estimating the actual meaning of input queries, addressing the concepts of the words which are expressed within the user questions. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate which semantic relation impacts the most in semantic expansion-based retrieval systems and to identify the best tradeoff between accuracy and noise introduction when combining such relations. The evaluations are made building a simple natural language processing system capable of querying any taxonomy-driven domain, making use of the combination of different semantic expansions as knowledge resources. The proposed evaluation employs a wide and varied taxonomy as a use-case, exploiting its labels as basis for the expansions. To build the knowledge resources several corpora have been produced and integrated as gazetteers into the NLP infrastructure with the purpose of estimating the pseudo-queries corresponding to the taxonomy labels, considered as the possible intents.", "label": 0}

However, medical image-text datasets are orders of magnitude below the general images and captions from the internet. Moreover, previous methods encounter many false negatives, i.e., images and reports from separate patients probably carry the same semantics but are wrongly treated as negatives. In this paper, we decouple images and texts for multimodal contrastive learning thus scaling the usable training data in a combinatorial magnitude with low cost. We also propose to replace the InfoNCE loss with semantic matching loss based on medical knowledge to eliminate false negatives in contrastive learning. We prove that MedCLIP is a simple yet effective framework: it outperforms state-of-the-art methods on zero-shot prediction, supervised classification, and image-text retrieval. Surprisingly, we observe that with only 20K pre-training data, MedCLIP wins over the state-of-the-art method (using around 200K data).

{"text": "Title: Probing Classifiers are Unreliable for Concept Removal and Detection\nAuthors: Abhinav Kumar, Chenhao Tan, Amit Sharma\nAbstract: Neural network models trained on text data have been found to encode undesirable linguistic or sensitive concepts in their representation. Removing such concepts is non-trivial because of a complex relationship between the concept, text input, and the learnt representation. Recent work has proposed post-hoc and adversarial methods to remove such unwanted concepts from a model's representation. Through an extensive theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that these methods can be counter-productive: they are unable to remove the concepts entirely, and in the worst case may end up destroying all task-relevant features. The reason is the methods' reliance on a probing classifier as a proxy for the concept. Even under the most favorable conditions for learning a probing classifier when a concept's relevant features in representation space alone can provide 100% accuracy, we prove that a probing classifier is likely to use non-concept features and thus post-hoc or adversarial methods will fail to remove the concept correctly. These theoretical implications are confirmed by experiments on models trained on synthetic, Multi-NLI, and Twitter datasets. For sensitive applications of concept removal such as fairness, we recommend caution against using these methods and propose a spuriousness metric to gauge the quality of the final classifier.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: ProGen: Progressive Zero-shot Dataset Generation via In-context Feedback\nAuthors: Jiacheng Ye, Jiahui Gao, Jiangtao Feng, Zhiyong Wu, Tao Yu, Lingpeng Kong\nAbstract: Recently, dataset-generation-based zero-shot learning has shown promising results by training a task-specific model with a dataset synthesized from large pre-trained language models (PLMs). The final task-specific model often achieves compatible or even better performance than PLMs under the zero-shot setting, with orders of magnitude fewer parameters. However, synthetic datasets have their drawbacks. They have long been suffering from low-quality issues (e.g., low informativeness and redundancy). This explains why the massive synthetic data does not lead to better performance -- a scenario we would expect in the human-labeled data. To improve the quality of dataset synthesis, we propose a progressive zero-shot dataset generation framework, ProGen, which leverages the feedback from the task-specific model to guide the generation of new training data via in-context examples. Extensive experiments on five text classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. We also show ProGen achieves on-par or superior performance with only 1\\% synthetic dataset size compared to baseline methods without in-context feedback.", "label": 0}

Recent progress in deep learning has brought tremendous improvements in natural language processing (NLP) and conversational AI, leading to a plethora of commercial conversational services that allow naturally spoken and typed interaction, increasing the need for more human-centric interactions in IR. As a result, we have witnessed a resurgent interest in developing modern CIR systems in both research communities and industry. This book surveys recent advances in CIR, focusing on neural approaches that have been developed in the last few years. This book is based on the authors' tutorial at SIGIR'2020 (Gao et al., 2020b), with IR and NLP communities as the primary target audience.

Multilingual ASR systems exhibit many advantages like scalability, maintainability, and improved performance over the monolingual ASR systems. However, building multilingual systems for Indian languages is challenging since different languages use different scripts for writing. On the other hand, Indian languages share a lot of common sounds. Common Label Set (CLS) exploits this idea and maps graphemes of various languages with similar sounds to common labels. Since Indian languages are mostly phonetic, building a parser to convert from native script to CLS is easy. In this paper, we explore various approaches to build multilingual ASR models. We also propose a novel architecture called Encoder-Decoder-Decoder for building multilingual systems that use both CLS and native script labels. We also analyzed the effectiveness of CLS-based multilingual systems combined with machine transliteration.", "label": 0}

In parallel, these improvements have prompted a heated discourse around the risks of societal harms they introduce, whether inadvertent or malicious. Several studies have identified potential causes of these harms and called for their mitigation via development of safer and fairer models. Going beyond enumerating the risks of harms, this work provides a survey of practical methods for addressing potential threats and societal harms from language generation models. We draw on several prior works' taxonomies of language model risks to present a structured overview of strategies for detecting and ameliorating different kinds of risks/harms of language generators. Bridging diverse strands of research, this survey aims to serve as a practical guide for both LM researchers and practitioners with explanations of motivations behind different mitigation strategies, their limitations, and open problems for future research.", "label": 0}

Instead, it uses the in-context learning ability of large language models to generate python-like modular programs, which are then executed to get both the solution and a comprehensive and interpretable rationale. Each line of the generated program may invoke one of several off-the-shelf computer vision models, image processing routines, or python functions to produce intermediate outputs that may be consumed by subsequent parts of the program. We demonstrate the flexibility of VISPROG on 4 diverse tasks - compositional visual question answering, zero-shot reasoning on image pairs, factual knowledge object tagging, and language-guided image editing. We believe neuro-symbolic approaches like VISPROG are an exciting avenue to easily and effectively expand the scope of AI systems to serve the long tail of complex tasks that people may wish to perform.", "label": 0}

The intrinsic complexity of these tasks demands powerful learning models. While pretrained Transformer-based Language Models (LM) have been shown to provide state-of-the-art results over different NLP tasks, the scarcity of manually annotated data and the highly domain-dependent nature of argumentation restrict the capabilities of such models. In this work, we propose a novel transfer learning strategy to overcome these challenges. We utilize argumentation-rich social discussions from the ChangeMyView subreddit as a source of unsupervised, argumentative discourse-aware knowledge by finetuning pretrained LMs on a selectively masked language modeling task. Furthermore, we introduce a novel prompt-based strategy for inter-component relation prediction that compliments our proposed finetuning method while leveraging on the discourse context. Exhaustive experiments show the generalization capability of our method on these two tasks over within-domain as well as out-of-domain datasets, outperforming several existing and employed strong baselines.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Learning the Beauty in Songs: Neural Singing Voice Beautifier\nAuthors: Jinglin Liu, Chengxi Li, Yi Ren, Zhiying Zhu, Zhou Zhao\nAbstract: We are interested in a novel task, singing voice beautifying (SVB). Given the singing voice of an amateur singer, SVB aims to improve the intonation and vocal tone of the voice, while keeping the content and vocal timbre. Current automatic pitch correction techniques are immature, and most of them are restricted to intonation but ignore the overall aesthetic quality. Hence, we introduce Neural Singing Voice Beautifier (NSVB), the first generative model to solve the SVB task, which adopts a conditional variational autoencoder as the backbone and learns the latent representations of vocal tone. In NSVB, we propose a novel time-warping approach for pitch correction: Shape-Aware Dynamic Time Warping (SADTW), which ameliorates the robustness of existing time-warping approaches, to synchronize the amateur recording with the template pitch curve. Furthermore, we propose a latent-mapping algorithm in the latent space to convert the amateur vocal tone to the professional one. To achieve this, we also propose a new dataset containing parallel singing recordings of both amateur and professional versions. Extensive experiments on both Chinese and English songs demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in terms of both objective and subjective metrics.

For example, GTC was first used to encode an N-best list of pseudo-label sequences into a graph for semi-supervised learning. In this paper, we propose an extension of GTC to model the posteriors of both labels and label transitions by a neural network, which can be applied to a wider range of tasks. As an example application, we use the extended GTC (GTC-e) for the multi-speaker speech recognition task. The transcriptions and speaker information of multi-speaker speech are represented by a graph, where the speaker information is associated with the transitions and ASR outputs with the nodes. Using GTC-e, multi-speaker ASR modelling becomes very similar to single-speaker ASR modeling, in that tokens by multiple speakers are recognized as a single merged sequence in chronological order. For evaluation, we perform experiments on a simulated multi-speaker speech dataset derived from LibriSpeech, obtaining promising results with performance close to classical benchmarks for the task.", "label": 0}

These show that support with women is stronger than support with migrants, but both have steadily increased over time. While we hardly find any direct anti-support with women, there is more polarization when it comes to migrants. We also discuss the difficulty of annotation as a result of ambiguity in political discourse and indirectness, i.e., politicians' tendency to relate stances attributed to political opponents. Overall, our results indicate that German society, as measured from its political elite, has become fairer over time.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: Evaluation of taxonomic and neural embedding methods for calculating semantic similarity\nAuthors: Dongqiang Yang, Yanqin Yin\nAbstract: Modelling semantic similarity plays a fundamental role in lexical semantic applications. A natural way of calculating semantic similarity is to access handcrafted semantic networks, but similarity prediction can also be anticipated in a distributional vector space. Similarity calculation continues to be a challenging task, even with the latest breakthroughs in deep neural language models. We first examined popular methodologies in measuring taxonomic similarity, including edge-counting that solely employs semantic relations in a taxonomy, as well as the complex methods that estimate concept specificity. We further extrapolated three weighting factors in modelling taxonomic similarity. To study the distinct mechanisms between taxonomic and distributional similarity measures, we ran head-to-head comparisons of each measure with human similarity judgements from the perspectives of word frequency, polysemy degree and similarity intensity. Our findings suggest that without fine-tuning the uniform distance, taxonomic similarity measures can depend on the shortest path length as a prime factor to predict semantic similarity; in contrast to distributional semantics, edge-counting is free from sense distribution bias in use and can measure word similarity both literally and metaphorically; the synergy of retrofitting neural embeddings with concept relations in similarity prediction may indicate a new trend to leverage knowledge bases on transfer learning. It appears that a large gap still exists on computing semantic similarity among different ranges of word frequency, polysemous degree and similarity intensity.", "label": 0}

However, the zero-shot translation is always unstable. Although prior works attributed the instability to the domination of central language, e.g. English, we supplement this viewpoint with the strict dependence of non-centered languages. In this work, we propose a simple, lightweight yet effective language-specific modeling method by adapting to non-centered languages and combining the shared information and the language-specific information to counteract the instability of zero-shot translation. Experiments with Transformer on IWSLT17, Europarl, TED talks, and OPUS-100 datasets show that our method not only performs better than strong baselines in centered data conditions but also can easily fit non-centered data conditions.

{"text": "Title: Generative Pre-Trained Transformers for Biologically Inspired Design\nAuthors: Qihao Zhu, Xinyu Zhang, Jianxi Luo\nAbstract: Biological systems in nature have evolved for millions of years to adapt and survive the environment. Many features they developed can be inspirational and beneficial for solving technical problems in modern industries. This leads to a novel form of design-by-analogy called bio-inspired design (BID). Although BID as a design method has been proven beneficial, the gap between biology and engineering continuously hinders designers from effectively applying the method. Therefore, we explore the recent advance of artificial intelligence (AI) for a computational approach to bridge the gap. This paper proposes a generative design approach based on the pre-trained language model (PLM) to automatically retrieve and map biological analogy and generate BID in the form of natural language. The latest generative pre-trained transformer, namely GPT-3, is used as the base PLM. Three types of design concept generators are identified and fine-tuned from the PLM according to the looseness of the problem space representation. Machine evaluators are also fine-tuned to assess the correlation between the domains within the generated BID concepts. The approach is then tested via a case study in which the fine-tuned models are applied to generate and evaluate light-weighted flying car concepts inspired by nature. The results show our approach can generate BID concepts with good performance.", "label": 0}

In the probing part of the model interpretability research, studies concern individual languages as well as individual linguistic structures. The question arises: are the detected regularities linguistically coherent, or on the contrary, do they dissonate at the typological scale? Moreover, the majority of studies address the inherent set of languages and linguistic structures, leaving the actual typological diversity knowledge out of scope. In this paper, we present and apply the GUI-assisted framework allowing us to easily probe a massive number of languages for all the morphosyntactic features present in the Universal Dependencies data. We show that reflecting the anglo-centric trend in NLP over the past years, most of the regularities revealed in the mBERT model are typical for the western-European languages. Our framework can be integrated with the existing probing toolboxes, model cards, and leaderboards, allowing practitioners to use and share their standard probing methods to interpret multilingual models. Thus we propose a toolkit to systematize the multilingual flaws in multilingual models, providing a reproducible experimental setup for 104 languages and 80 morphosyntactic features. https://github.com/AIRI-Institute/Probing_framework", "label": 0}

For the task of Machine Translation (MT), morphological segmentation has proven successful in alleviating data sparsity in monolingual contexts; however, it has not been investigated for CS settings. In this paper, we study the effectiveness of different segmentation approaches on MT performance, covering morphology-based and frequency-based segmentation techniques. We experiment on MT from code-switched Arabic-English to English. We provide detailed analysis, examining a variety of conditions, such as data size and sentences with different degrees in CS. Empirical results show that morphology-aware segmenters perform the best in segmentation tasks but under-perform in MT. Nevertheless, we find that the choice of the segmentation setup to use for MT is highly dependent on the data size.

For more resourced settings, such a combination does not bring significant improvements over the use of frequency-based segmentation.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: LongFNT: Long-form Speech Recognition with Factorized Neural Transducer\nAuthors: Xun Gong, Yu Wu, Jinyu Li, Shujie Liu, Rui Zhao, Xie Chen, Yanmin Qian\nAbstract: Traditional automatic speech recognition~(ASR) systems usually focus on individual utterances, without considering long-form speech with useful historical information, which is more practical in real scenarios. Simply attending longer transcription history for a vanilla neural transducer model shows no much gain in our preliminary experiments, since the prediction network is not a pure language model. This motivates us to leverage the factorized neural transducer structure, containing a real language model, the vocabulary predictor. We propose the {LongFNT-Text} architecture, which fuses the sentence-level long-form features directly with the output of the vocabulary predictor and then embeds token-level long-form features inside the vocabulary predictor, with a pre-trained contextual encoder RoBERTa to further boost the performance. Moreover, we propose the {LongFNT} architecture by extending the long-form speech to the original speech input and achieve the best performance. The effectiveness of our LongFNT approach is validated on LibriSpeech and GigaSpeech corpora with 19% and 12% relative word error rate~(WER) reduction, respectively.", "label": 0}

People with low health literacy usually have trouble understanding health information, following post-visit instructions, and using prescriptions, which results in worse health outcomes and serious health disparities. In this study, we propose to leverage natural language processing techniques to improve health literacy in patient education materials by automatically translating illiterate languages in a given sentence. We scraped patient education materials from four online health information websites: MedlinePlus.gov, Drugs.com, Mayoclinic.org and Reddit.com. We trained and tested the state-of-the-art neural machine translation (NMT) models on a silver standard training dataset and a gold standard testing dataset, respectively. The experimental results showed that the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) NMT model outperformed Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-based NMT models. We also verified the effectiveness of NMT models in translating health illiterate languages by comparing the ratio of health illiterate language in the sentence. The proposed NMT models were able to identify the correct complicated words and simplify into layman language while at the same time the models suffer from sentence completeness, fluency, readability, and have difficulty in translating certain medical terms.", "label": 0}

However, solving JTM is domain-specific and non-trivial due to its inherent challenges: (1) user-created job titles are messy, (2) different job titles often overlap their job requirements, (3) job transition trajectories are inconsistent, and (4) the number of job titles in real world applications is large-scale. Toward this JTM problem, in this work, we propose a novel solution, named as JAMES, that constructs three unique embeddings of a target job title: topological, semantic, and syntactic embeddings, together with multi-aspect co-attention. In addition, we employ logical reasoning representations to collaboratively estimate similarities between messy job titles and standard job titles in the reasoning space. We conduct comprehensive experiments against ten competing models on the large-scale real-world dataset with more than 350,000 job titles. Our results show that JAMES significantly outperforms the best baseline by 10.06% in Precision@10 and by 17.52% in NDCG@10, respectively.", "label": 0}

Producing a coherent and non-trivial explanation requires awareness of the dialogue's structure and of how an event is grounded in the context. In this work, we create CICEROv2, a dataset consisting of 8,351 instances from 2,379 dialogues, containing multiple human-written answers for each contextual commonsense inference question, representing a type of explanation on cause, subsequent event, motivation, and emotional reaction. We show that the inferences in CICEROv2 are more semantically diverse than other contextual commonsense inference datasets. To solve the inference task, we propose a collection of pre-training objectives, including concept denoising and utterance sorting to prepare a pre-trained model for the downstream contextual commonsense inference task. Our results show that the proposed pre-training objectives are effective at adapting the pre-trained T5-Large model for the contextual commonsense inference task.", "label": 0}

This work focuses on a challenging case of OOD detection, where no labels for in-domain data are accessible (e.g., no intent labels for the intent classification task). To this end, we first evaluate different language model based approaches that predict likelihood for a sequence of tokens. Furthermore, we propose a novel representation learning based method by combining unsupervised clustering and contrastive learning so that better data representations for OOD detection can be learned. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that this method can significantly outperform likelihood-based methods and can be even competitive to the state-of-the-art supervised approaches with label information.", "label": 0}

In this paper, we aim to improve this kind of cross-task generalization ability of massive multi-task language models, such as T0 and FLAN, in an unsupervised setting. We propose a retrieval-augmentation method named ReCross that takes a few unlabelled examples as queries to retrieve a small subset of upstream data and uses them to update the multi-task model for better generalization. ReCross is a straightforward yet effective retrieval method that combines both efficient dense retrieval and effective pair-wise reranking.

In light of such, a personalized and educational vocabulary recommendation system that traces a learner's vocabulary knowledge state would have an immense learning impact as it could resolve both issues. Therefore, in this paper, we propose and release data for a novel task called Pedagogical Word Recommendation (PWR). The main goal of PWR is to predict whether a given learner knows a given word based on other words the learner has already seen. To elaborate, we collect this data via an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) that is serviced to ~1M L2 learners who study for the standardized English exam, TOEIC. As a feature of this ITS, students can directly indicate words they do not know from the questions they solved to create wordbooks. Finally, we report the evaluation results of a Neural Collaborative Filtering approach along with an exploratory data analysis and discuss the impact and efficacy of this dataset as a baseline for future studies on this task.", "label": 0}

Commercialized APIs such as OpenAI GPT-3 further increase their use in real-world language applications. However, existing research focuses on models' accuracy on standard benchmarks and largely ignores their reliability, which is crucial for avoiding catastrophic real-world harms. While reliability is a broad and vaguely defined term, this work decomposes reliability into four facets: generalizability, fairness, calibration, and factuality. We establish simple and effective prompts to demonstrate GPT-3's reliability in these four aspects: 1) generalize out-of-domain, 2) balance demographic distribution to reduce social biases, 3) calibrate language model probabilities, and 4) update the LLM's knowledge. We find that by employing appropriate prompts, GPT-3 outperforms smaller-scale supervised models by large margins on all these facets. We release all processed datasets, evaluation scripts, and model predictions to facilitate future analysis. Our findings not only shed new insights on the reliability of prompting LLMs, but more importantly, our prompting strategies can help practitioners more reliably use large language models like GPT-3.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Prompt-based Connective Prediction Method for Fine-grained Implicit Discourse Relation Recognition\nAuthors: Hao Zhou, Man Lan, Yuanbin Wu, Yuefeng Chen, Meirong Ma\nAbstract: Due to the absence of connectives, implicit discourse relation recognition (IDRR) is still a challenging and crucial task in discourse analysis. Most of the current work adopted multi-task learning to aid IDRR through explicit discourse relation recognition (EDRR) or utilized dependencies between discourse relation labels to constrain model predictions. But these methods still performed poorly on fine-grained IDRR and even utterly misidentified on most of the few-shot discourse relation classes. To address these problems, we propose a novel Prompt-based Connective Prediction (PCP) method for IDRR. Our method instructs large-scale pre-trained models to use knowledge relevant to discourse relation and utilizes the strong correlation between connectives and discourse relation to help the model recognize implicit discourse relations. Experimental results show that our method surpasses the current state-of-the-art model and achieves significant improvements on those fine-grained few-shot discourse relation. Moreover, our approach is able to be transferred to EDRR and obtain acceptable results. Our code is released in https://github.com/zh-i9/PCP-for-IDRR.", "label": 0}

Conversations containing rich personal knowledge can be regarded as a main source to populate the PKB. Given a user, a user attribute, and user utterances from a conversational system, we aim to predict the personal attribute value for the user, which is helpful for the enrichment of PKBs. However, there are three issues existing in previous studies: (1) manually labeled utterances are required for model training; (2) personal attribute knowledge embedded in both utterances and external resources is underutilized; (3) the performance on predicting some difficult personal attributes is unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose a framework DSCGN based on the pre-trained language model with a noise-robust loss function to predict personal attributes from conversations without requiring any labeled utterances. We yield two categories of supervision, i.e., document-level supervision via a distant supervision strategy and contextualized word-level supervision via a label guessing method, by mining the personal attribute knowledge embedded in both unlabeled utterances and external resources to fine-tune the language model. Extensive experiments over two real-world data sets (i.e., a profession data set and a hobby data set) show our framework obtains the best performance compared with all the twelve baselines in terms of nDCG and MRR.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: GRIT: Faster and Better Image captioning Transformer Using Dual Visual Features\nAuthors: Van-Quang Nguyen, Masanori Suganuma, Takayuki Okatani\nAbstract: Current state-of-the-art methods for image captioning employ region-based features, as they provide object-level information that is essential to describe the content of images; they are usually extracted by an object detector such as Faster R-CNN. However, they have several issues, such as lack of contextual information, the risk of inaccurate detection, and the high computational cost. The first two could be resolved by additionally using grid-based features. However, how to extract and fuse these two types of features is uncharted. This paper proposes a Transformer-only neural architecture, dubbed GRIT (Grid- and Region-based Image captioning Transformer), that effectively utilizes the two visual features to generate better captions. GRIT replaces the CNN-based detector employed in previous methods with a DETR-based one, making it computationally faster. Moreover, its monolithic design consisting only of Transformers enables end-to-end training of the model. This innovative design and the integration of the dual visual features bring about significant performance improvement. The experimental results on several image captioning benchmarks show that GRIT outperforms previous methods in inference accuracy and speed.", "label": 0}

While recent work on document-level extraction has gone beyond single-sentence and increased the cross-sentence inference capability of end-to-end models, they are still restricted by certain input sequence length constraints and usually ignore the global context between events. To tackle this issue, we introduce a new global neural generation-based framework for document-level event argument extraction by constructing a document memory store to record the contextual event information and leveraging it to implicitly and explicitly help with decoding of arguments for later events. Empirical results show that our framework outperforms prior methods substantially and it is more robust to adversarially annotated examples with our constrained decoding design.

The knowledge presented in the literature needs to be systematized in such a way that claims and hypotheses can be easily found, accessed, and validated. Knowledge graphs can provide such a framework for semantic knowledge representation from literature. However, in order to build a knowledge graph, it is necessary to extract knowledge as relationships between biomedical entities and normalize both entities and relationship types. In this paper, we present and compare few rule-based and machine learning-based (Naive Bayes, Random Forests as examples of traditional machine learning methods and DistilBERT, PubMedBERT, T5 and SciFive-based models as examples of modern deep learning transformers) methods for scalable relationship extraction from biomedical literature, and for the integration into the knowledge graphs. We examine how resilient are these various methods to unbalanced and fairly small datasets. Our experiments show that transformer-based models handle well both small (due to pre-training on a large dataset) and unbalanced datasets. The best performing model was the PubMedBERT-based model fine-tuned on balanced data, with a reported F1-score of 0.92. DistilBERT-based model followed with F1-score of 0.89, performing faster and with lower resource requirements. BERT-based models performed better then T5-based generative models.", "label": 0}

Many previous ensemble based debiasing methods have been proposed where an additional model is purposefully trained to be biased in order to aid in training a robust target model. However, these methods compute the bias for a model from the label statistics of the training data or directly from single modal branches. In contrast, in this work, in order to better learn the bias a target VQA model suffers from, we propose a generative method to train the bias model \\emph{directly from the target model}, called GenB. In particular, GenB employs a generative network to learn the bias through a combination of the adversarial objective and knowledge distillation. We then debias our target model with GenB as a bias model, and show through extensive experiments the effects of our method on various VQA bias datasets including VQA-CP2, VQA-CP1, GQA-OOD, and VQA-CE.", "label": 0}

In this paper, to address these problems, we introduce a seminal knowledge prompting paradigm and further propose a knowledge-prompting-based PLM framework KP-PLM. This framework can be flexibly combined with existing mainstream PLMs. Specifically, we first construct a knowledge sub-graph from KBs for each context. Then we design multiple continuous prompts rules and transform the knowledge sub-graph into natural language prompts. To further leverage the factual knowledge from these prompts, we propose two novel knowledge-aware self-supervised tasks including prompt relevance inspection and masked prompt modeling. Extensive experiments on multiple natural language understanding (NLU) tasks show the superiority of KP-PLM over other state-of-the-art methods in both full-resource and low-resource settings.", "label": 0}

Sainath, Ruoming Pang, Trevor Strohman, Shankar Kumar\nAbstract: Language model fusion helps smart assistants recognize words which are rare in acoustic data but abundant in text-only corpora (typed search logs). However, such corpora have properties that hinder downstream performance, including being (1) too large, (2) beset with domain-mismatched content, and (3) heavy-headed rather than heavy-tailed (excessively many duplicate search queries such as \"weather\"). We show that three simple strategies for selecting language modeling data can dramatically improve rare-word recognition without harming overall performance. First, to address the heavy-headedness, we downsample the data according to a soft log function, which tunably reduces high frequency (head) sentences. Second, to encourage rare-word exposure, we explicitly filter for words rare in the acoustic data. Finally, we tackle domain-mismatch via perplexity-based contrastive selection, filtering for examples matched to the target domain. We down-select a large corpus of web search queries by a factor of 53x and achieve better LM perplexities than without down-selection. When shallow-fused with a state-of-the-art, production speech engine, our LM achieves WER reductions of up to 24% relative on rare-word sentences (without changing overall WER) compared to a baseline LM trained on the raw corpus. These gains are further validated through favorable side-by-side evaluations on live voice search traffic.", "label": 0}

This paper constructs a test set for 12 dialects of English that spans three years at monthly intervals with a fixed spatial distribution across 1,120 cities. Syntactic representations are formulated within the usage-based Construction Grammar paradigm (CxG). The decay rate of classification performance for each dialect over time allows us to identify regions undergoing syntactic change. And the distribution of classification accuracy within dialect regions allows us to identify the degree to which the grammar of a dialect is internally heterogeneous. The main contribution of this paper is to show that a rigorous evaluation of dialect classification models can be used to find both variation over space and change over time.", "label": 0}

However, the pre-trained models treat the input passage as a flat sequence and are thus not aware of the text structure of input passage. For QG task, we model text structure as answer position and syntactic dependency, and propose answer localness modeling and syntactic mask attention to address these limitations. Specially, we present localness modeling with a Gaussian bias to enable the model to focus on answer-surrounded context, and propose a mask attention mechanism to make the syntactic structure of input passage accessible in question generation process.

Although there have been many successful attempts to construct multimodal representations for MSA, there are still two challenges to be addressed: 1) A more robust multimodal representation needs to be constructed to bridge the heterogeneity gap and cope with the complex multimodal interactions, and 2) the contextual dynamics must be modeled effectively throughout the information flow. In this work, we propose a multimodal representation model based on Mutual information Maximization and Minimization and Identity Embedding (MMMIE). We combine mutual information maximization between modal pairs, and mutual information minimization between input data and corresponding features to mine the modal-invariant and task-related information. Furthermore, Identity Embedding is proposed to prompt the downstream network to perceive the contextual information.

In this paper, we introduce a new metric called SMART to mitigate such limitations. Specifically, We treat sentences as basic units of matching instead of tokens, and use a sentence matching function to soft-match candidate and reference sentences. Candidate sentences are also compared to sentences in the source documents to allow grounding (e.g., factuality) evaluation. Our results show that system-level correlations of our proposed metric with a model-based matching function outperforms all competing metrics on the SummEval summarization meta-evaluation dataset, while the same metric with a string-based matching function is competitive with current model-based metrics. The latter does not use any neural model, which is useful during model development phases where resources can be limited and fast evaluation is required. Finally, we also conducted extensive analyses showing that our proposed metrics work well with longer summaries and are less biased towards specific models.", "label": 0}

Wong, Simon See\nAbstract: Commonsense Knowledge Base (CSKB) Population aims at reasoning over unseen entities and assertions on CSKBs, and is an important yet hard commonsense reasoning task. One challenge is that it requires out-of-domain generalization ability as the source CSKB for training is of a relatively smaller scale (1M) while the whole candidate space for population is way larger (200M). We propose PseudoReasoner, a semi-supervised learning framework for CSKB population that uses a teacher model pre-trained on CSKBs to provide pseudo labels on the unlabeled candidate dataset for a student model to learn from. The teacher can be a generative model rather than restricted to discriminative models as previous works. In addition, we design a new filtering procedure for pseudo labels based on influence function and the student model's prediction to further improve the performance. The framework can improve the backbone model KG-BERT (RoBERTa-large) by 3.3 points on the overall performance and especially, 5.3 points on the out-of-domain performance, and achieves the state-of-the-art.

{"text": "Title: Pragmatic constraints and pronoun reference disambiguation: the possible and the impossible\nAuthors: Ernest Davis\nAbstract: Pronoun disambiguation in understanding text and discourse often requires the application of both general pragmatic knowledge and context-specific information. In AI and linguistics research, this has mostly been studied in cases where the referent is explicitly stated in the preceding text nearby. However, pronouns in natural text often refer to entities, collections, or events that are only implicitly mentioned previously; in those cases the need to use pragmatic knowledge to disambiguate becomes much more acute and the characterization of the knowledge becomes much more difficult. Extended literary texts at times employ both extremely complex patterns of reference and extremely rich and subtle forms of knowledge. Indeed, it is occasionally possible to have a pronoun that is far separated from its referent in a text. In the opposite direction, pronoun use is affected by considerations of focus of attention and by formal constraints such as a preference for parallel syntactic structures; these can be so strong that no pragmatic knowledge suffices to overrule them.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Repurposing Knowledge Graph Embeddings for Triple Representation via Weak Supervision\nAuthors: Alexander Kalinowski, Yuan An\nAbstract: The majority of knowledge graph embedding techniques treat entities and predicates as separate embedding matrices, using aggregation functions to build a representation of the input triple. However, these aggregations are lossy, i.e. they do not capture the semantics of the original triples, such as information contained in the predicates. To combat these shortcomings, current methods learn triple embeddings from scratch without utilizing entity and predicate embeddings from pre-trained models. In this paper, we design a novel fine-tuning approach for learning triple embeddings by creating weak supervision signals from pre-trained knowledge graph embeddings. We develop a method for automatically sampling triples from a knowledge graph and estimating their pairwise similarities from pre-trained embedding models. These pairwise similarity scores are then fed to a Siamese-like neural architecture to fine-tune triple representations. We evaluate the proposed method on two widely studied knowledge graphs and show consistent improvement over other state-of-the-art triple embedding methods on triple classification and triple clustering tasks.", "label": 0}

Performing knowledge distillation for such models is not trivial due to their exponentially large output space. In this work, we propose an approach that is much simpler in its formulation and far more efficient for training than existing approaches. Specifically, we transfer the knowledge from a teacher model to its student model by locally matching their predictions on all sub-structures, instead of the whole output space. In this manner, we avoid adopting some time-consuming techniques like dynamic programming (DP) for decoding output structures, which permits parallel computation and makes the training process even faster in practice. Besides, it encourages the student model to better mimic the internal behavior of the teacher model.

Strimel\nAbstract: Recent years have seen significant advances in end-to-end (E2E) spoken language understanding (SLU) systems, which directly predict intents and slots from spoken audio. While dialogue history has been exploited to improve conventional text-based natural language understanding systems, current E2E SLU approaches have not yet incorporated such critical contextual signals in multi-turn and task-oriented dialogues. In this work, we propose a contextual E2E SLU model architecture that uses a multi-head attention mechanism over encoded previous utterances and dialogue acts (actions taken by the voice assistant) of a multi-turn dialogue. We detail alternative methods to integrate these contexts into the state-ofthe-art recurrent and transformer-based models. When applied to a large de-identified dataset of utterances collected by a voice assistant, our method reduces average word and semantic error rates by 10.8% and 12.6%, respectively. We also present results on a publicly available dataset and show that our method significantly improves performance over a noncontextual baseline", "label": 0}

Although word co-occurrences in context have been widely used in counting-/predicting-based distributional models, the role of syntactic dependencies in deriving distributional semantics has not yet been thoroughly investigated. By comparing various Vector Space Models in detecting synonyms in TOEFL, we systematically study the salience of syntactic dependencies in accounting for distributional similarity. We separate syntactic dependencies into different groups according to their various grammatical roles and then use context-counting to construct their corresponding raw and SVD-compressed matrices. Moreover, using the same training hyperparameters and corpora, we study typical neural embeddings in the evaluation. We further study the effectiveness of injecting human-compiled semantic knowledge into neural embeddings on computing distributional similarity. Our results show that the syntactically conditioned contexts can interpret lexical semantics better than the unconditioned ones, whereas retrofitting neural embeddings with semantic knowledge can significantly improve synonym detection.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Programming Language Agnostic Mining of Code and Language Pairs with Sequence Labeling Based Question Answering\nAuthors: Changran Hu, Akshara Reddi Methukupalli, Yutong Zhou, Chen Wu, Yubo Chen\nAbstract: Mining aligned natural language (NL) and programming language (PL) pairs is a critical task to NL-PL understanding. Existing methods applied specialized hand-crafted features or separately-trained models for each PL. However, they usually suffered from low transferability across multiple PLs, especially for niche PLs with less annotated data. Fortunately, a Stack Overflow answer post is essentially a sequence of text and code blocks and its global textual context can provide PL-agnostic supplementary information. In this paper, we propose a Sequence Labeling based Question Answering (SLQA) method to mine NL-PL pairs in a PL-agnostic manner. In particular, we propose to apply the BIO tagging scheme instead of the conventional binary scheme to mine the code solutions which are often composed of multiple blocks of a post. Experiments on current single-PL single-block benchmarks and a manually-labeled cross-PL multi-block benchmark prove the effectiveness and transferability of SLQA. We further present a parallel NL-PL corpus named Lang2Code automatically mined with SLQA, which contains about 1.4M pairs on 6 PLs. Under statistical analysis and downstream evaluation, we demonstrate that Lang2Code is a large-scale high-quality data resource for further NL-PL research.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: SNCSE: Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised Sentence Embedding with Soft Negative Samples\nAuthors: Hao Wang, Yangguang Li, Zhen Huang, Yong Dou, Lingpeng Kong, Jing Shao\nAbstract: Unsupervised sentence embedding aims to obtain the most appropriate embedding for a sentence to reflect its semantic. Contrastive learning has been attracting developing attention. For a sentence, current models utilize diverse data augmentation methods to generate positive samples, while consider other independent sentences as negative samples. Then they adopt InfoNCE loss to pull the embeddings of positive pairs gathered, and push those of negative pairs scattered. Although these models have made great progress on sentence embedding, we argue that they may suffer from feature suppression. The models fail to distinguish and decouple textual similarity and semantic similarity. And they may overestimate the semantic similarity of any pairs with similar textual regardless of the actual semantic difference between them. This is because positive pairs in unsupervised contrastive learning come with similar and even the same textual through data augmentation. To alleviate feature suppression, we propose contrastive learning for unsupervised sentence embedding with soft negative samples (SNCSE). Soft negative samples share highly similar textual but have surely and apparently different semantic with the original samples. Specifically, we take the negation of original sentences as soft negative samples, and propose Bidirectional Margin Loss (BML) to introduce them into traditional contrastive learning framework, which merely involves positive and negative samples. Our experimental results show that SNCSE can obtain state-of-the-art performance on semantic textual similarity (STS) task with average Spearman's correlation coefficient of 78.97% on BERTbase and 79.23% on RoBERTabase. Besides, we adopt rank-based error analysis method to detect the weakness of SNCSE for future study.", "label": 0}

Le, Fan Bai, Alan Ritter\nAbstract: Anaphora resolution is an important task for information extraction across a range of languages, text genres, and domains, motivating the need for methods that do not require large annotated datasets. In-context learning has emerged as a promising approach, yet there are a number of challenges in applying in-context learning to resolve anaphora. For example, encoding a single in-context demonstration that consists of: an anaphor, a paragraph-length context, and a list of corresponding antecedents, requires conditioning a language model on a long sequence of tokens, limiting the number of demonstrations per prompt. In this paper, we present MICE (Mixtures of In-Context Experts), which we demonstrate is effective for few-shot anaphora resolution in scientific protocols (Tamari et al., 2021). Given only a handful of training examples, MICE combines the predictions of hundreds of in-context experts, yielding a 30% increase in F1 score over a competitive prompt retrieval baseline. Furthermore, we show MICE can be used to train compact student models without sacrificing performance. As far as we are aware, this is the first work to present experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of in-context learning on the task of few-shot anaphora resolution in scientific protocols.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Boosting Natural Language Generation from Instructions with Meta-Learning\nAuthors: Budhaditya Deb, Guoqing Zheng, Ahmed Hassan Awadallah\nAbstract: Recent work has shown that language models (LMs) trained with multi-task \\textit{instructional learning} (MTIL) can solve diverse NLP tasks in zero- and few-shot settings with improved performance compared to prompt tuning. MTIL illustrates that LMs can extract and use information about the task from instructions beyond the surface patterns of the inputs and outputs. This suggests that meta-learning may further enhance the utilization of instructions for effective task transfer. In this paper we investigate whether meta-learning applied to MTIL can further improve generalization to unseen tasks in a zero-shot setting. Specifically, we propose to adapt meta-learning to MTIL in three directions: 1) Model Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML), 2) Hyper-Network (HNet) based adaptation to generate task specific parameters conditioned on instructions, and 3) an approach combining HNet and MAML. Through extensive experiments on the large scale Natural Instructions V2 dataset, we show that our proposed approaches significantly improve over strong baselines in zero-shot settings. In particular, meta-learning improves the effectiveness of instructions and is most impactful when the test tasks are strictly zero-shot (i.e. no similar tasks in the training set) and are \"hard\" for LMs, illustrating the potential of meta-learning for MTIL for out-of-distribution tasks.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Token Classification for Disambiguating Medical Abbreviations\nAuthors: Mucahit Cevik, Sanaz Mohammad Jafari, Mitchell Myers, Savas Yildirim\nAbstract: Abbreviations are unavoidable yet critical parts of the medical text. Using abbreviations, especially in clinical patient notes, can save time and space, protect sensitive information, and help avoid repetitions. However, most abbreviations might have multiple senses, and the lack of a standardized mapping system makes disambiguating abbreviations a difficult and time-consuming task. The main objective of this study is to examine the feasibility of token classification methods for medical abbreviation disambiguation. Specifically, we explore the capability of token classification methods to deal with multiple unique abbreviations in a single text. We use two public datasets to compare and contrast the performance of several transformer models pre-trained on different scientific and medical corpora. Our proposed token classification approach outperforms the more commonly used text classification models for the abbreviation disambiguation task. In particular, the SciBERT model shows a strong performance for both token and text classification tasks over the two considered datasets. Furthermore, we find that abbreviation disambiguation performance for the text classification models becomes comparable to that of token classification only when postprocessing is applied to their predictions, which involves filtering possible labels for an abbreviation based on the training data.", "label": 0}

However, the general principles that should guide the choice of decoding algorithm remain unclear. Previous works only compare decoding algorithms in narrow scenarios and their findings do not generalize across tasks. To better structure the discussion, we introduce a taxonomy that groups decoding strategies based on their implicit assumptions about how well the model's likelihood is aligned with the task-specific notion of utility. We argue that this taxonomy allows a broader view of the decoding problem and can lead to generalizable statements because it is grounded on the interplay between the decoding algorithms and the likelihood-utility misalignment. Specifically, by analyzing the correlation between the likelihood and the utility of predictions across a diverse set of tasks, we provide the first empirical evidence supporting the proposed taxonomy, and a set of principles to structure reasoning when choosing a decoding algorithm. Crucially, our analysis is the first one to relate likelihood-based decoding strategies with strategies that rely on external information such as value-guided methods and prompting, and covers the most diverse set of tasks up-to-date.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Tri-Attention: Explicit Context-Aware Attention Mechanism for Natural Language Processing\nAuthors: Rui Yu, Yifeng Li, Wenpeng Lu, Longbing Cao\nAbstract: In natural language processing (NLP), the context of a word or sentence plays an essential role. Contextual information such as the semantic representation of a passage or historical dialogue forms an essential part of a conversation and a precise understanding of the present phrase or sentence. However, the standard attention mechanisms typically generate weights using query and key but ignore context, forming a Bi-Attention framework, despite their great success in modeling sequence alignment. This Bi-Attention mechanism does not explicitly model the interactions between the contexts, queries and keys of target sequences, missing important contextual information and resulting in poor attention performance. Accordingly, a novel and general triple-attention (Tri-Attention) framework expands the standard Bi-Attention mechanism and explicitly interacts query, key, and context by incorporating context as the third dimension in calculating relevance scores. Four variants of Tri-Attention are generated by expanding the two-dimensional vector-based additive, dot-product, scaled dot-product, and bilinear operations in Bi-Attention to the tensor operations for Tri-Attention. Extensive experiments on three NLP tasks demonstrate that Tri-Attention outperforms about 30 state-of-the-art non-attention, standard Bi-Attention, contextual Bi-Attention approaches and pretrained neural language models1.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Locating and Editing Factual Associations in GPT\nAuthors: Kevin Meng, David Bau, Alex Andonian, Yonatan Belinkov\nAbstract: We analyze the storage and recall of factual associations in autoregressive transformer language models, finding evidence that these associations correspond to localized, directly-editable computations. We first develop a causal intervention for identifying neuron activations that are decisive in a model's factual predictions. This reveals a distinct set of steps in middle-layer feed-forward modules that mediate factual predictions while processing subject tokens. To test our hypothesis that these computations correspond to factual association recall, we modify feed-forward weights to update specific factual associations using Rank-One Model Editing (ROME). We find that ROME is effective on a standard zero-shot relation extraction (zsRE) model-editing task, comparable to existing methods. To perform a more sensitive evaluation, we also evaluate ROME on a new dataset of counterfactual assertions, on which it simultaneously maintains both specificity and generalization, whereas other methods sacrifice one or another. Our results confirm an important role for mid-layer feed-forward modules in storing factual associations and suggest that direct manipulation of computational mechanisms may be a feasible approach for model editing.

Generally, kNN-MT borrows the off-the-shelf context representation in the translation task, e.g., the output of the last decoder layer, as the query vector of the retrieval task. In this work, we highlight that coupling the representations of these two tasks is sub-optimal for fine-grained retrieval. To alleviate it, we leverage supervised contrastive learning to learn the distinctive retrieval representation derived from the original context representation. We also propose a fast and effective approach to constructing hard negative samples. Experimental results on five domains show that our approach improves the retrieval accuracy and BLEU score compared to vanilla kNN-MT.", "label": 0}

Existing generation algorithms must avoid both unlikely strings, which are incoherent, and highly likely ones, which are short and repetitive. We propose contrastive decoding (CD), a more reliable search objective that returns the difference between likelihood under a large LM (called the expert, e.g. OPT-13b) and a small LM (called the amateur, e.g. OPT-125m). CD is inspired by the fact that the failures of larger LMs are even more prevalent in smaller LMs, and that this difference signals exactly which texts should be preferred. CD requires zero training, and produces higher quality text than decoding from the larger LM alone. It also generalizes across model types (OPT and GPT2) and significantly outperforms four strong decoding algorithms in automatic and human evaluations.", "label": 0}

This fact implies the need for resources to evaluate these models. In the case of Spanish, there are few ways to systematically assess the models' quality. In this paper, we narrow the gap by building two evaluation benchmarks. Inspired by previous work (Conneau and Kiela, 2018; Chen et al., 2019), we introduce Spanish SentEval and Spanish DiscoEval, aiming to assess the capabilities of stand-alone and discourse-aware sentence representations, respectively. Our benchmarks include considerable pre-existing and newly constructed datasets that address different tasks from various domains. In addition, we evaluate and analyze the most recent pre-trained Spanish language models to exhibit their capabilities and limitations. As an example, we discover that for the case of discourse evaluation tasks, mBERT, a language model trained on multiple languages, usually provides a richer latent representation than models trained only with documents in Spanish. We hope our contribution will motivate a fairer, more comparable, and less cumbersome way to evaluate future Spanish language models.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Are We There Yet? A Decision Framework for Replacing Term Based Retrieval with Dense Retrieval Systems\nAuthors: Sebastian Hofst\u00e4tter, Nick Craswell, Bhaskar Mitra, Hamed Zamani, Allan Hanbury\nAbstract: Recently, several dense retrieval (DR) models have demonstrated competitive performance to term-based retrieval that are ubiquitous in search systems. In contrast to term-based matching, DR projects queries and documents into a dense vector space and retrieves results via (approximate) nearest neighbor search. Deploying a new system, such as DR, inevitably involves tradeoffs in aspects of its performance. Established retrieval systems running at scale are usually well understood in terms of effectiveness and costs, such as query latency, indexing throughput, or storage requirements. In this work, we propose a framework with a set of criteria that go beyond simple effectiveness measures to thoroughly compare two retrieval systems with the explicit goal of assessing the readiness of one system to replace the other. This includes careful tradeoff considerations between effectiveness and various cost factors. Furthermore, we describe guardrail criteria, since even a system that is better on average may have systematic failures on a minority of queries. The guardrails check for failures on certain query characteristics and novel failure types that are only possible in dense retrieval systems. We demonstrate our decision framework on a Web ranking scenario. In that scenario, state-of-the-art DR models have surprisingly strong results, not only on average performance but passing an extensive set of guardrail tests, showing robustness on different query characteristics, lexical matching, generalization, and number of regressions. It is impossible to predict whether DR will become ubiquitous in the future, but one way this is possible is through repeated applications of decision processes such as the one presented here.", "label": 0}

Existing SQA methods all rely on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcripts. Not only does ASR need to be trained with massive annotated data that are time and cost-prohibitive to collect for low-resourced languages, but more importantly, very often the answers to the questions include name entities or out-of-vocabulary words that cannot be recognized correctly. Also, ASR aims to minimize recognition errors equally over all words, including many function words irrelevant to the SQA task. Therefore, SQA without ASR transcripts (textless) is always highly desired, although known to be very difficult.   This work proposes Discrete Spoken Unit Adaptive Learning (DUAL), leveraging unlabeled data for pre-training and fine-tuned by the SQA downstream task. The time intervals of spoken answers can be directly predicted from spoken documents. We also release a new SQA benchmark corpus, NMSQA, for data with more realistic scenarios. We empirically showed that DUAL yields results comparable to those obtained by cascading ASR and text QA model and robust to real-world data. Our code and model will be open-sourced.", "label": 0}

Online hate speech is more accessible than ever, and stifling its propagation is of utmost importance for social media companies and users for congenial communication. Most of the research barring a recent few has focused on classifying an individual tweet regardless of the tweet thread/context leading up to that point. One of the classical approaches to curb hate speech is to adopt a reactive strategy after the hate speech postage. The ex-post facto strategy results in neglecting subtle posts that do not show the potential to instigate hate speech on their own but may portend in the subsequent discussion ensuing in the post's replies. In this paper, we propose DRAGNET++, which aims to predict the intensity of hatred that a tweet can bring in through its reply chain in the future. It uses the semantic and propagating structure of the tweet threads to maximize the contextual information leading up to and the fall of hate intensity at each subsequent tweet. We explore three publicly available Twitter datasets -- Anti-Racism contains the reply tweets of a collection of social media discourse on racist remarks during US political and Covid-19 background; Anti-Social presents a dataset of 40 million tweets amidst the COVID-19 pandemic on anti-social behaviours; and Anti-Asian presents Twitter datasets collated based on anti-Asian behaviours during COVID-19 pandemic. All the curated datasets consist of structural graph information of the Tweet threads. We show that DRAGNET++ outperforms all the state-of-the-art baselines significantly. It beats the best baseline by an 11% margin on the Person correlation coefficient and a decrease of 25% on RMSE for the Anti-Racism dataset with a similar performance on the other two datasets.", "label": 0}

Then, we bridge the gap between the semantic-equivalent representations of different languages at the token level by minimizing the proposed distance to learn universal representations. Besides, we propose an agreement-based training scheme, which can help the model make consistent predictions based on the semantic-equivalent sentences to learn universal cross-mapping relationships for all translation directions. The experimental results on diverse multilingual datasets show that our method can improve consistently compared with the baseline system and other contrast methods.

However, such latency reduction sacrifices the ability to capture left-to-right dependencies, thereby making NAT learning very challenging. In this paper, we present theoretical and empirical analyses to reveal the challenges of NAT learning and propose a unified perspective to understand existing successes. First, we show that simply training NAT by maximizing the likelihood can lead to an approximation of marginal distributions but drops all dependencies between tokens, where the dropped information can be measured by the dataset's conditional total correlation. Second, we formalize many previous objectives in a unified framework and show that their success can be concluded as maximizing the likelihood on a proxy distribution, leading to a reduced information loss. Empirical studies show that our perspective can explain the phenomena in NAT learning and guide the design of new training methods.", "label": 0}

However, most existing methods are based on static word co-occurrence graphs without sentence-level information, which poses three challenges:(1) word ambiguity, (2) word synonymity, and (3) dynamic contextual dependency. To address these challenges, we propose a novel GNN-based sparse structure learning model for inductive document classification. Specifically, a document-level graph is initially generated by a disjoint union of sentence-level word co-occurrence graphs. Our model collects a set of trainable edges connecting disjoint words between sentences and employs structure learning to sparsely select edges with dynamic contextual dependencies. Graphs with sparse structures can jointly exploit local and global contextual information in documents through GNNs. For inductive learning, the refined document graph is further fed into a general readout function for graph-level classification and optimization in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms most state-of-the-art results, and reveal the necessity to learn sparse structures for each document.", "label": 0}

The news content, unlike traditional text, has a temporal component. However, few works have explored the combination of natural language processing and dynamic system models. One reason is that it is challenging to mathematically model the nuances of natural language. In this paper, we discuss how we built a novel dataset of news articles collected over time. Then, we present a method of converting news text collected over time to a sequence of directed multi-graphs, which represent semantic triples (Subject -> Predicate} ->Object). We model the dynamics of specific topological changes in these graphs using a set of multivariate count series, which we fit the discrete-time Hawkes process. With our real-world data, we show that the multivariate time series contain both dynamic information of how many articles/words were published each day and semantic information of the content of the articles. This yields novel insights into how news events are covered. We show with the experiment that our approach can be used to infer from a sequence of news articles if the articles were published by major or entertainment news outlets.", "label": 0}

In recent years, deep-learning-based approaches have substantially improved the performance of SAS models, but how to guarantee high-quality predictions still remains a critical issue when applying such models to the education field. Towards guaranteeing high-quality predictions, we present the first study of exploring the use of human-in-the-loop framework for minimizing the grading cost while guaranteeing the grading quality by allowing a SAS model to share the grading task with a human grader. Specifically, by introducing a confidence estimation method for indicating the reliability of the model predictions, one can guarantee the scoring quality by utilizing only predictions with high reliability for the scoring results and casting predictions with low reliability to human graders. In our experiments, we investigate the feasibility of the proposed framework using multiple confidence estimation methods and multiple SAS datasets. We find that our human-in-the-loop framework allows automatic scoring models and human graders to achieve the target scoring quality.", "label": 0}

However, because typical sentences on product reviews contain various details, users must identify sentences about components they want to know amongst the many reviews. Therefore, we aimed to develop a system that identifies and collects component and aspect information of products in sentences. Our BERT-based classifiers assign labels referring to components and aspects to sentences in reviews and extract sentences with comments on specific components and aspects. We determined proper labels based for the words identified through pattern matching from product reviews to create the training data. Because we could not use the words as labels, we carefully created labels covering the meanings of the words. However, the training data was imbalanced on component and aspect pairs. We introduced a data augmentation method using WordNet to reduce the bias. Our evaluation demonstrates that the system can determine labels for road bikes using pattern matching, covering more than 88\\% of the indicators of components and aspects on e-commerce sites.

In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs to generate both reasoning traces and task-specific actions in an interleaved manner, allowing for greater synergy between the two: reasoning traces help the model induce, track, and update action plans as well as handle exceptions, while actions allow it to interface with external sources, such as knowledge bases or environments, to gather additional information. We apply our approach, named ReAct, to a diverse set of language and decision making tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness over state-of-the-art baselines, as well as improved human interpretability and trustworthiness over methods without reasoning or acting components. Concretely, on question answering (HotpotQA) and fact verification (Fever), ReAct overcomes issues of hallucination and error propagation prevalent in chain-of-thought reasoning by interacting with a simple Wikipedia API, and generates human-like task-solving trajectories that are more interpretable than baselines without reasoning traces. On two interactive decision making benchmarks (ALFWorld and WebShop), ReAct outperforms imitation and reinforcement learning methods by an absolute success rate of 34% and 10% respectively, while being prompted with only one or two in-context examples.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: Behind the Mask: Demographic bias in name detection for PII masking\nAuthors: Courtney Mansfield, Amandalynne Paullada, Kristen Howell\nAbstract: Many datasets contain personally identifiable information, or PII, which poses privacy risks to individuals. PII masking is commonly used to redact personal information such as names, addresses, and phone numbers from text data. Most modern PII masking pipelines involve machine learning algorithms. However, these systems may vary in performance, such that individuals from particular demographic groups bear a higher risk for having their personal information exposed. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of three off-the-shelf PII masking systems on name detection and redaction. We generate data using names and templates from the customer service domain. We find that an open-source RoBERTa-based system shows fewer disparities than the commercial models we test. However, all systems demonstrate significant differences in error rate based on demographics. In particular, the highest error rates occurred for names associated with Black and Asian/Pacific Islander individuals.", "label": 0}

Unlike sentence-level ASR, conversational ASR can naturally take advantages from specific characteristics of conversation, such as role preference and topical coherence. This paper proposes a conversational ASR model which explicitly learns conversation-level characteristics under the prevalent end-to-end neural framework. The highlights of the proposed model are twofold. First, a latent variational module (LVM) is attached to a conformer-based encoder-decoder ASR backbone to learn role preference and topical coherence. Second, a topic model is specifically adopted to bias the outputs of the decoder to words in the predicted topics. Experiments on two Mandarin conversational ASR tasks show that the proposed model achieves a maximum 12% relative character error rate (CER) reduction.", "label": 0}

However, in non-idempotent semirings admitting an order satisfying a monotonicity condition (such as the plus-times or log semirings), the notion of shortest string is well-defined. We describe an algorithm which finds the shortest string for a weighted non-deterministic automaton over such semirings using the backwards shortest distance of an equivalent deterministic automaton (DFA) as a heuristic for A* search performed over a companion idempotent semiring, which is proven to return the shortest string. While there may be exponentially more states in the DFA, this algorithm needs to visit only a small fraction of them if determinization is performed \"on the fly\".", "label": 0}

Recent works have demonstrated that the performance of such direct S2ST systems is approaching that of conventional cascade S2ST when trained on comparable datasets. However, in practice, the performance of direct S2ST is bounded by the availability of paired S2ST training data. In this work, we explore multiple approaches for leveraging much more widely available unsupervised and weakly-supervised speech and text data to improve the performance of direct S2ST based on Translatotron 2. With our most effective approaches, the average translation quality of direct S2ST on 21 language pairs on the CVSS-C corpus is improved by +13.6 BLEU (or +113% relatively), as compared to the previous state-of-the-art trained without additional data. The improvements on low-resource language are even more significant (+398% relatively on average).

{"text": "Title: Automatic Evaluation and Analysis of Idioms in Neural Machine Translation\nAuthors: Christos Baziotis, Prashant Mathur, Eva Hasler\nAbstract: A major open problem in neural machine translation (NMT) is the translation of idiomatic expressions, such as \"under the weather\". The meaning of these expressions is not composed by the meaning of their constituent words, and NMT models tend to translate them literally (i.e., word-by-word), which leads to confusing and nonsensical translations. Research on idioms in NMT is limited and obstructed by the absence of automatic methods for quantifying these errors. In this work, first, we propose a novel metric for automatically measuring the frequency of literal translation errors without human involvement. Equipped with this metric, we present controlled translation experiments with models trained in different conditions (with/without the test-set idioms) and across a wide range of (global and targeted) metrics and test sets. We explore the role of monolingual pretraining and find that it yields substantial targeted improvements, even without observing any translation examples of the test-set idioms. In our analysis, we probe the role of idiom context. We find that the randomly initialized models are more local or \"myopic\" as they are relatively unaffected by variations of the idiom context, unlike the pretrained ones.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Moving beyond word lists: towards abstractive topic labels for human-like topics of scientific documents\nAuthors: Domenic Rosati\nAbstract: Topic models represent groups of documents as a list of words (the topic labels). This work asks whether an alternative approach to topic labeling can be developed that is closer to a natural language description of a topic than a word list. To this end, we present an approach to generating human-like topic labels using abstractive multi-document summarization (MDS). We investigate our approach with an exploratory case study. We model topics in citation sentences in order to understand what further research needs to be done to fully operationalize MDS for topic labeling. Our case study shows that in addition to more human-like topics there are additional advantages to evaluation by using clustering and summarization measures instead of topic model measures. However, we find that there are several developments needed before we can design a well-powered study to evaluate MDS for topic modeling fully. Namely, improving cluster cohesion, improving the factuality and faithfulness of MDS, and increasing the number of documents that might be supported by MDS. We present a number of ideas on how these can be tackled and conclude with some thoughts on how topic modeling can also be used to improve MDS in general.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Inductive Knowledge Graph Reasoning for Multi-batch Emerging Entities\nAuthors: Yuanning Cui, Yuxin Wang, Zequn Sun, Wenqiang Liu, Yiqiao Jiang, Kexin Han, Wei Hu\nAbstract: Over the years, reasoning over knowledge graphs (KGs), which aims to infer new conclusions from known facts, has mostly focused on static KGs. The unceasing growth of knowledge in real life raises the necessity to enable the inductive reasoning ability on expanding KGs. Existing inductive work assumes that new entities all emerge once in a batch, which oversimplifies the real scenario that new entities continually appear. This study dives into a more realistic and challenging setting where new entities emerge in multiple batches. We propose a walk-based inductive reasoning model to tackle the new setting. Specifically, a graph convolutional network with adaptive relation aggregation is designed to encode and update entities using their neighboring relations. To capture the varying neighbor importance, we employ a query-aware feedback attention mechanism during the aggregation. Furthermore, to alleviate the sparse link problem of new entities, we propose a link augmentation strategy to add trustworthy facts into KGs. We construct three new datasets for simulating this multi-batch emergence scenario. The experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art embedding-based, walk-based and rule-based models on inductive KG reasoning.", "label": 0}

The main challenge of this task comes two-fold: few-shot learning resulting from the varying targets and the lack of contextual information of the targets. Existing works mainly focus on solving the second issue by designing attention-based models or introducing noisy external knowledge, while the first issue remains under-explored. In this paper, inspired by the potential capability of pre-trained language models (PLMs) serving as knowledge bases and few-shot learners, we propose to introduce prompt-based fine-tuning for stance detection. PLMs can provide essential contextual information for the targets and enable few-shot learning via prompts. Considering the crucial role of the target in stance detection task, we design target-aware prompts and propose a novel verbalizer. Instead of mapping each label to a concrete word, our verbalizer maps each label to a vector and picks the label that best captures the correlation between the stance and the target. Moreover, to alleviate the possible defect of dealing with varying targets with a single hand-crafted prompt, we propose to distill the information learned from multiple prompts. Experimental results show the superior performance of our proposed model in both full-data and few-shot scenarios.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: Instance-wise Prompt Tuning for Pretrained Language Models\nAuthors: Yuezihan Jiang, Hao Yang, Junyang Lin, Hanyu Zhao, An Yang, Chang Zhou, Hongxia Yang, Zhi Yang, Bin Cui\nAbstract: Prompt Learning has recently gained great popularity in bridging the gap between pretraining tasks and various downstream tasks. It freezes Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) and only tunes a few task-related parameters (prompts) for downstream tasks, greatly reducing the cost of tuning giant models. The key enabler of this is the idea of querying PLMs with task-specific knowledge implicated in prompts. This paper reveals a major limitation of existing methods that the indiscriminate prompts for all input data in a task ignore the intrinsic knowledge from input data, resulting in sub-optimal performance. We introduce Instance-wise Prompt Tuning (IPT), the first prompt learning paradigm that injects knowledge from the input data instances to the prompts, thereby providing PLMs with richer and more concrete context information. We devise a series of strategies to produce instance-wise prompts, addressing various concerns like model quality and cost-efficiency. Across multiple tasks and resource settings, IPT significantly outperforms task-based prompt learning methods, and achieves comparable performance to conventional finetuning with only 0.5% - 1.5% of tuned parameters.", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: Multimodal Dialogue State Tracking\nAuthors: Hung Le, Nancy F. Chen, Steven C. H. Hoi\nAbstract: Designed for tracking user goals in dialogues, a dialogue state tracker is an essential component in a dialogue system. However, the research of dialogue state tracking has largely been limited to unimodality, in which slots and slot values are limited by knowledge domains (e.g. restaurant domain with slots of restaurant name and price range) and are defined by specific database schema. In this paper, we propose to extend the definition of dialogue state tracking to multimodality. Specifically, we introduce a novel dialogue state tracking task to track the information of visual objects that are mentioned in video-grounded dialogues. Each new dialogue utterance may introduce a new video segment, new visual objects, or new object attributes, and a state tracker is required to update these information slots accordingly. We created a new synthetic benchmark and designed a novel baseline, Video-Dialogue Transformer Network (VDTN), for this task. VDTN combines both object-level features and segment-level features and learns contextual dependencies between videos and dialogues to generate multimodal dialogue states. We optimized VDTN for a state generation task as well as a self-supervised video understanding task which recovers video segment or object representations. Finally, we trained VDTN to use the decoded states in a response prediction task. Together with comprehensive ablation and qualitative analysis, we discovered interesting insights towards building more capable multimodal dialogue systems.", "label": 0}

However, as we show, fine-tuning an LLM on any specific task generally destroys its in-context ability. We discover an important cause of this loss, format specialization, where the model overfits to the format of the fine-tuned task and is unable to output anything beyond this format. We further show that format specialization happens at the beginning of fine-tuning. To solve this problem, we propose Prompt Tuning with MOdel Tuning (ProMoT), a simple yet effective two-stage fine-tuning framework that preserves in-context abilities of the pretrained model. ProMoT first trains a soft prompt for the fine-tuning target task, and then fine-tunes the model itself with this soft prompt attached. ProMoT offloads task-specific formats into the soft prompt that can be removed when doing other in-context tasks. We fine-tune mT5 XXL with ProMoT on natural language inference (NLI) and English-French translation and evaluate the in-context abilities of the resulting models on 8 different NLP tasks. ProMoT achieves similar performance on the fine-tuned tasks compared with vanilla fine-tuning, but with much less reduction of in-context learning performances across the board. More importantly, ProMoT shows remarkable generalization ability on tasks that have different formats, e.g. fine-tuning on a NLI binary classification task improves the model's in-context ability to do summarization (+0.53 Rouge-2 score compared to the pretrained model), making ProMoT a promising method to build general purpose capabilities such as grounding and reasoning into LLMs with small but high quality datasets. When extended to sequential or multi-task training, ProMoT can achieve even better out-of-domain generalization performance.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Propose-and-Refine: A Two-Stage Set Prediction Network for Nested Named Entity Recognition\nAuthors: Shuhui Wu, Yongliang Shen, Zeqi Tan, Weiming Lu\nAbstract: Nested named entity recognition (nested NER) is a fundamental task in natural language processing. Various span-based methods have been proposed to detect nested entities with span representations. However, span-based methods do not consider the relationship between a span and other entities or phrases, which is helpful in the NER task. Besides, span-based methods have trouble predicting long entities due to limited span enumeration length. To mitigate these issues, we present the Propose-and-Refine Network (PnRNet), a two-stage set prediction network for nested NER. In the propose stage, we use a span-based predictor to generate some coarse entity predictions as entity proposals. In the refine stage, proposals interact with each other, and richer contextual information is incorporated into the proposal representations. The refined proposal representations are used to re-predict entity boundaries and classes. In this way, errors in coarse proposals can be eliminated, and the boundary prediction is no longer constrained by the span enumeration length limitation. Additionally, we build multi-scale sentence representations, which better model the hierarchical structure of sentences and provide richer contextual information than token-level representations. Experiments show that PnRNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on four nested NER datasets and one flat NER dataset.", "label": 0}

However, these models can be biased in multiple ways, including the unfounded association of male and female genders with gender-neutral professions. Therefore, knowledge distillation without any fairness constraints may preserve or exaggerate the teacher model's biases onto the distilled model. To this end, we present a novel approach to mitigate gender disparity in text generation by learning a fair model during knowledge distillation. We propose two modifications to the base knowledge distillation based on counterfactual role reversal$\\unicode{x2014}$modifying teacher probabilities and augmenting the training set. We evaluate gender polarity across professions in open-ended text generated from the resulting distilled and finetuned GPT$\\unicode{x2012}$2 models and demonstrate a substantial reduction in gender disparity with only a minor compromise in utility. Finally, we observe that language models that reduce gender polarity in language generation do not improve embedding fairness or downstream classification fairness.", "label": 0}

Large pre-trained language models produce impressive results on various style classification tasks. However, they often learn spurious domain-specific words to make predictions. This incorrect word importance learned by the model often leads to ambiguous token-level explanations which do not align with human perception of linguistic styles. To tackle this challenge, we introduce StyLEx, a model that learns annotated human perceptions of stylistic lexica and uses these stylistic words as additional information for predicting the style of a sentence. Our experiments show that StyLEx can provide human-like stylistic lexical explanations without sacrificing the performance of sentence-level style prediction on both original and out-of-domain datasets. Explanations from StyLEx show higher sufficiency, and plausibility when compared to human annotations, and are also more understandable by human judges compared to the existing widely-used saliency baseline.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Contrastive Search Is What You Need For Neural Text Generation\nAuthors: Yixuan Su, Nigel Collier\nAbstract: Generating text with autoregressive language models (LMs) is of great importance to many natural language processing (NLP) applications. Previous solutions for this task often produce text that contains degenerative expressions or lacks semantic consistency. Recently, Su et al. introduced a new decoding method, contrastive search, based on the isotropic representation space of the language model and obtained new state of the art on various benchmarks. Additionally, Su et al. argued that the representations of autoregressive LMs (e.g. GPT-2) are intrinsically anisotropic which is also shared by previous studies. Therefore, to ensure the language model follows an isotropic distribution, Su et al. proposed a contrastive learning scheme, SimCTG, which calibrates the language model's representations through additional training.   In this study, we first answer the question: \"Are autoregressive LMs really anisotropic?\". To this end, we extensively evaluate the isotropy of LMs across 16 major languages. Surprisingly, we find that the anisotropic problem only exists in the two specific English GPT-2-small/medium models. On the other hand, all other evaluated LMs are naturally isotropic which is in contrast to the conclusion drawn by previous studies. Based on our findings, we further assess the contrastive search decoding method using off-the-shelf LMs on four generation tasks across 16 languages. Our experimental results demonstrate that contrastive search significantly outperforms previous decoding methods without any additional training. More notably, on 12 out of the 16 evaluated languages, contrastive search performs comparably with human-level performances as judged by human evaluations.", "label": 0}

Existing benchmarks measure reasoning ability indirectly, by evaluating accuracy on downstream tasks such as mathematical reasoning. However, it is unclear how these models obtain the answers and whether they rely on simple heuristics rather than the generated chain-of-thought. To enable systematic exploration of the reasoning ability of LLMs, we present a new synthetic question-answering dataset called PrOntoQA, where each example is generated from a synthetic world model represented in first-order logic. This allows us to parse the generated chain-of-thought into symbolic proofs for formal analysis. Our analysis on InstructGPT and GPT-3 shows that LLMs are quite capable of making correct individual deduction steps, and so are generally capable of reasoning, even in fictional contexts. However, they have difficulty with proof planning: When multiple valid deduction steps are available, they are not able to systematically explore the different options.", "label": 0}

With recent advances in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), voice assistants are increasingly useful in our everyday lives. Many technologies in education, retail, telecommunication and healthcare can now be operated through voice. Unfortunately, these benefits are not accessible for People Who Stutter (PWS). We propose a simple but effective method called 'Detect and Pass' to make modern ASR systems accessible for People Who Stutter in a limited data setting. The algorithm uses a context aware classifier trained on a limited amount of data, to detect acoustic frames that contain stutter. To improve robustness on stuttered speech, this extra information is passed on to the ASR model to be utilized during inference. Our experiments show a reduction of 12.18% to 71.24% in Word Error Rate (WER) across various state of the art ASR systems. Upon varying the threshold of the associated posterior probability of stutter for each stacked frame used in determining low frame rate (LFR) acoustic features, we were able to determine an optimal setting that reduced the WER by 23.93% to 71.67% across different ASR systems.", "label": 0}

However, ASR in robots faces additional challenges as compared to a personal assistant. Being an embodied agent, a robot must recognize the physical entities around it and therefore reliably recognize the speech containing the description of such entities. However, current ASR systems are often unable to do so due to limitations in ASR training, such as generic datasets and open-vocabulary modeling. Also, adverse conditions during inference, such as noise, accented, and far-field speech makes the transcription inaccurate. In this work, we present a method to incorporate a robot's visual information into an ASR system and improve the recognition of a spoken utterance containing a visible entity. Specifically, we propose a new decoder biasing technique to incorporate the visual context while ensuring the ASR output does not degrade for incorrect context. We achieve a 59% relative reduction in WER from an unmodified ASR system.", "label": 0}

An example is an object classifier trained on red squares and blue circles: when encountering blue squares, the intended behavior is undefined. We investigate whether pretrained models are better active learners, capable of disambiguating between the possible tasks a user may be trying to specify. Intriguingly, we find that better active learning is an emergent property of the pretraining process: pretrained models require up to 5 times fewer labels when using uncertainty-based active learning, while non-pretrained models see no or even negative benefit. We find these gains come from an ability to select examples with attributes that disambiguate the intended behavior, such as rare product categories or atypical backgrounds. These attributes are far more linearly separable in pretrained model's representation spaces vs non-pretrained models, suggesting a possible mechanism for this behavior.", "label": 0}

To analyze how this ambiguity (also known as intrinsic uncertainty) shapes the distribution learned by neural sequence models we measure sentence-level uncertainty by computing the degree of overlap between references in multi-reference test sets from two different NLP tasks: machine translation (MT) and grammatical error correction (GEC). At both the sentence- and the task-level, intrinsic uncertainty has major implications for various aspects of search such as the inductive biases in beam search and the complexity of exact search. In particular, we show that well-known pathologies such as a high number of beam search errors, the inadequacy of the mode, and the drop in system performance with large beam sizes apply to tasks with high level of ambiguity such as MT but not to less uncertain tasks such as GEC. Furthermore, we propose a novel exact $n$-best search algorithm for neural sequence models, and show that intrinsic uncertainty affects model uncertainty as the model tends to overly spread out the probability mass for uncertain tasks and sentences.", "label": 0}

Dragut, Weiyi Meng\nAbstract: Microblogging sites, like Twitter, have emerged as ubiquitous sources of information. Two important tasks related to the automatic extraction and analysis of information in Microblogs are Entity Mention Detection (EMD) and Entity Detection (ED). The state-of-the-art EMD systems aim to model the non-literary nature of microblog text by training upon offline static datasets. They extract a combination of surface-level features -- orthographic, lexical, and semantic -- from individual messages for noisy text modeling and entity extraction. But given the constantly evolving nature of microblog streams, detecting all entity mentions from such varying yet limited context of short messages remains a difficult problem. To this end, we propose a framework named EMD Globalizer, better suited for the execution of EMD learners on microblog streams. It deviates from the processing of isolated microblog messages by existing EMD systems, where learned knowledge from the immediate context of a message is used to suggest entities. After an initial extraction of entity candidates by an EMD system, the proposed framework leverages occurrence mining to find additional candidate mentions that are missed during this first detection. Aggregating the local contextual representations of these mentions, a global embedding is drawn from the collective context of an entity candidate within a stream. The global embeddings are then utilized to separate entities within the candidates from false positives. All mentions of said entities from the stream are produced in the framework's final outputs.

Hebart\nAbstract: Semantic features have been playing a central role in investigating the nature of our conceptual representations. Yet the enormous time and effort required to empirically sample and norm features from human raters has restricted their use to a limited set of manually curated concepts. Given recent promising developments with transformer-based language models, here we asked whether it was possible to use such models to automatically generate meaningful lists of properties for arbitrary object concepts and whether these models would produce features similar to those found in humans. To this end, we probed a GPT-3 model to generate semantic features for 1,854 objects and compared automatically-generated features to existing human feature norms. GPT-3 generated many more features than humans, yet showed a similar distribution in the types of generated features. Generated feature norms rivaled human norms in predicting similarity, relatedness, and category membership, while variance partitioning demonstrated that these predictions were driven by similar variance in humans and GPT-3. Together, these results highlight the potential of large language models to capture important facets of human knowledge and yield a new approach for automatically generating interpretable feature sets, thus drastically expanding the potential use of semantic features in psychological and linguistic studies.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Context-Dependent Semantic Parsing for Temporal Relation Extraction\nAuthors: Bo-Ying Su, Shang-Ling Hsu, Kuan-Yin Lai, Jane Yung-jen Hsu\nAbstract: Extracting temporal relations among events from unstructured text has extensive applications, such as temporal reasoning and question answering. While it is difficult, recent development of Neural-symbolic methods has shown promising results on solving similar tasks. Current temporal relation extraction methods usually suffer from limited expressivity and inconsistent relation inference. For example, in TimeML annotations, the concept of intersection is absent. Additionally, current methods do not guarantee the consistency among the predicted annotations. In this work, we propose SMARTER, a neural semantic parser, to extract temporal information in text effectively. SMARTER parses natural language to an executable logical form representation, based on a custom typed lambda calculus. In the training phase, dynamic programming on denotations (DPD) technique is used to provide weak supervision on logical forms. In the inference phase, SMARTER generates a temporal relation graph by executing the logical form. As a result, our neural semantic parser produces logical forms capturing the temporal information of text precisely. The accurate logical form representations of an event given the context ensure the correctness of the extracted relations.", "label": 0}

Kuo, Zoltan Tuske, Samuel Thomas, Brian Kingsbury, George Saon\nAbstract: The goal of spoken language understanding (SLU) systems is to determine the meaning of the input speech signal, unlike speech recognition which aims to produce verbatim transcripts. Advances in end-to-end (E2E) speech modeling have made it possible to train solely on semantic entities, which are far cheaper to collect than verbatim transcripts. We focus on this set prediction problem, where entity order is unspecified. Using two classes of E2E models, RNN transducers and attention based encoder-decoders, we show that these models work best when the training entity sequence is arranged in spoken order. To improve E2E SLU models when entity spoken order is unknown, we propose a novel data augmentation technique along with an implicit attention based alignment method to infer the spoken order. F1 scores significantly increased by more than 11% for RNN-T and about 2% for attention based encoder-decoder SLU models, outperforming previously reported results.", "label": 0}

Some of these difficulties can be alleviated by an approach that takes diagrams seriously as mathematical formalisms in their own right. Stock & flow diagrams are widely used as broadly accessible building blocks for infectious disease modeling. In this chapter, rather than focusing on the underlying mathematics, we informally use communicable disease examples created by the implemented software of StockFlow.jl to explain the basics, characteristics, and benefits of the categorical framework. We first characterize categorical stock & flow diagrams, and note the clear separation between the syntax of stock & flow diagrams and their semantics, demonstrating three examples of semantics already implemented in the software: ODEs, causal loop diagrams, and system structure diagrams. We then establish composition and stratification frameworks and examples for stock & flow diagrams. Applying category theory, these frameworks can build large diagrams from smaller ones in a modular fashion. Finally, we introduce the open-source ModelCollab software for diagram-centric real-time collaborative modeling. Using the graphical user interface, this web-based software allows the user to undertake the types of categorically-rooted operations discussed above, but without any knowledge of their categorical foundations.", "label": 0}

As a result, the current research in the field has largely been exploratory: focusing on establishing new problems, techniques, and phenomena. Yet after these problems have been established, subsequent progress requires research which can measurably demonstrate how it improves on prior approaches. This type of research is what we call systematic research; in this paper, we illustrate this mode of research specifically for emergent language. We first identify the overarching goals of emergent language research, categorizing them as either science or engineering. Using this distinction, we present core methodological elements of science and engineering, analyze their role in current emergent language research, and recommend how to apply these elements.", "label": 0}

In practice, existing systems may lack the means to validate their privacy-preserving claims, leading to problems of transparency and reproducibility. We introduce DP-Rewrite, an open-source framework for differentially private text rewriting which aims to solve these problems by being modular, extensible, and highly customizable.

For example, analysis of a legal case summarization dataset demonstrates that sentences serving different types of argumentative roles in the decision appear in different sections of the document. In this work, we propose an unsupervised graph-based ranking model that uses a reweighting algorithm to exploit properties of the document structure of legal case decisions.

However, some details of interactions between doctors and patients may be ignored or omitted in EHRs, which are essential for automatic medication recommendation. Therefore, we make the first attempt to recommend medications with the conversations between doctors and patients. In this work, we construct DIALMED, the first high-quality dataset for medical dialogue-based medication recommendation task. It contains 11,996 medical dialogues related to 16 common diseases from 3 departments and 70 corresponding common medications. Furthermore, we propose a Dialogue structure and Disease knowledge aware Network (DDN), where a QA Dialogue Graph mechanism is designed to model the dialogue structure and the knowledge graph is used to introduce external disease knowledge. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is a promising solution to recommend medications with medical dialogues.

Pre-trained language models have been effective in many NLP tasks. However, these models are often huge and produce large sentence embeddings. Moreover, there is a big performance gap between large and small models. In this paper, we propose Homomorphic Projective Distillation (HPD) to learn compressed sentence embeddings. Our method augments a small Transformer encoder model with learnable projection layers to produce compact representations while mimicking a large pre-trained language model to retain the sentence representation quality. We evaluate our method with different model sizes on both semantic textual similarity (STS) and semantic retrieval (SR) tasks. Experiments show that our method achieves 2.7-4.5 points performance gain on STS tasks compared with previous best representations of the same size. In SR tasks, our method improves retrieval speed (8.2$\\times$) and memory usage (8.0$\\times$) compared with state-of-the-art large models.", "label": 0}

We evaluate the simple and cost-effective method of concatenating the original data examples to build new training instances. Continued training with such augmented data is able to improve off-the-shelf Transformer and Conformer models that were optimized on the original data only. We demonstrate considerable improvements on the LibriSpeech-960h test sets (WER 2.83 and 6.87 for test-clean and test-other), which carry over to models combined with shallow fusion (WER 2.55 and 6.27). Our method of continued training also leads to improvements of up to 0.9 WER on the ASR part of CoVoST-2 for four non English languages, and we observe that the gains are highly dependent on the size of the original training data. We compare different concatenation strategies and found that our method does not need speaker information to achieve its improvements.

In this work, we study this question by contrasting social biases with non-social biases stemming from choices made during dataset construction that might not even be discernible to the human eye. To do so, we empirically simulate various alternative constructions for a given benchmark based on innocuous modifications (such as paraphrasing or random-sampling) that maintain the essence of their social bias. On two well-known social bias benchmarks (Winogender and BiasNLI) we observe that these shallow modifications have a surprising effect on the resulting degree of bias across various models. We hope these troubling observations motivate more robust measures of social biases.", "label": 0}

However, most word embedding methods assign only one vector to a word, even if polysemous words have multi-senses. To address this limitation, we propose SememeWSD Synonym (SWSDS) model to assign a different vector to every sense of polysemous words with the help of word sense disambiguation (WSD) and synonym set in OpenHowNet. We use the SememeWSD model, an unsupervised word sense disambiguation model based on OpenHowNet, to do word sense disambiguation and annotate the polysemous word with sense id. Then, we obtain top 10 synonyms of the word sense from OpenHowNet and calculate the average vector of synonyms as the vector of the word sense. In experiments, We evaluate the SWSDS model on semantic similarity calculation with Gensim's wmdistance method. It achieves improvement of accuracy. We also examine the SememeWSD model on different BERT models to find the more effective model.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Robust Disentangled Variational Speech Representation Learning for Zero-shot Voice Conversion\nAuthors: Jiachen Lian, Chunlei Zhang, Dong Yu\nAbstract: Traditional studies on voice conversion (VC) have made progress with parallel training data and known speakers. Good voice conversion quality is obtained by exploring better alignment modules or expressive mapping functions. In this study, we investigate zero-shot VC from a novel perspective of self-supervised disentangled speech representation learning. Specifically, we achieve the disentanglement by balancing the information flow between global speaker representation and time-varying content representation in a sequential variational autoencoder (VAE). A zero-shot voice conversion is performed by feeding an arbitrary speaker embedding and content embeddings to the VAE decoder. Besides that, an on-the-fly data augmentation training strategy is applied to make the learned representation noise invariant. On TIMIT and VCTK datasets, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on both objective evaluation, i.e., speaker verification (SV) on speaker embedding and content embedding, and subjective evaluation, i.e., voice naturalness and similarity, and remains to be robust even with noisy source/target utterances.", "label": 0}

Recent studies have explored improving pre-trained language models to boost dense retrieval performance. This paper proposes CoT-MAE (ConTextual Masked Auto-Encoder), a simple yet effective generative pre-training method for dense passage retrieval. CoT-MAE employs an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture that learns to compress the sentence semantics into a dense vector through self-supervised and context-supervised masked auto-encoding. Precisely, self-supervised masked auto-encoding learns to model the semantics of the tokens inside a text span, and context-supervised masked auto-encoding learns to model the semantical correlation between the text spans. We conduct experiments on large-scale passage retrieval benchmarks and show considerable improvements over strong baselines, demonstrating the high efficiency of CoT-MAE.", "label": 0}

Modern NLP models are prone to stealing by querying and distilling from their publicly exposed APIs. However, existing protection methods such as watermarking only work for images but are not applicable to text. We propose Distillation-Resistant Watermarking (DRW), a novel technique to protect NLP models from being stolen via distillation. DRW protects a model by injecting watermarks into the victim's prediction probability corresponding to a secret key and is able to detect such a key by probing a suspect model. We prove that a protected model still retains the original accuracy within a certain bound. We evaluate DRW on a diverse set of NLP tasks including text classification, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition. Experiments show that DRW protects the original model and detects stealing suspects at 100% mean average precision for all four tasks while the prior method fails on two.", "label": 0}

However, modern multimodal models are typically black-box neural networks, which makes it challenging to understand their internal mechanics. How can we visualize the internal modeling of multimodal interactions in these models? Our paper aims to fill this gap by proposing MultiViz, a method for analyzing the behavior of multimodal models by scaffolding the problem of interpretability into 4 stages: (1) unimodal importance: how each modality contributes towards downstream modeling and prediction, (2) cross-modal interactions: how different modalities relate with each other, (3) multimodal representations: how unimodal and cross-modal interactions are represented in decision-level features, and (4) multimodal prediction: how decision-level features are composed to make a prediction. MultiViz is designed to operate on diverse modalities, models, tasks, and research areas. Through experiments on 8 trained models across 6 real-world tasks, we show that the complementary stages in MultiViz together enable users to (1) simulate model predictions, (2) assign interpretable concepts to features, (3) perform error analysis on model misclassifications, and (4) use insights from error analysis to debug models. MultiViz is publicly available, will be regularly updated with new interpretation tools and metrics, and welcomes inputs from the community.", "label": 0}

Among them are low-rank projection methods such as Linformer and kernel-based Transformers. Despite their unique merits, they usually suffer from a performance drop comparing with the vanilla transformer on many sequence generation tasks, and often fail to obtain computation gain when the generation is short. We propose MemSizer, an approach towards closing the performance gap while improving the efficiency even with short generation. It projects the source sequences into lower dimension representations like Linformer, while enjoying efficient recurrent-style incremental computation similar to kernel-based transformers. This yields linear computation time and constant memory complexity at inference time. MemSizer also employs a lightweight multi-head mechanism which renders the computation as light as a single-head model. We demonstrate that MemSizer provides an improved balance between efficiency and accuracy over the vanilla transformer and other efficient transformer variants in three typical sequence generation tasks, including machine translation, abstractive text summarization, and language modeling.", "label": 0}

Previous KD practices for pre-trained language models mainly transfer knowledge by aligning instance-wise outputs between the teacher and student, while neglecting an important knowledge source, i.e., the gradient of the teacher. The gradient characterizes how the teacher responds to changes in inputs, which we assume is beneficial for the student to better approximate the underlying mapping function of the teacher. Therefore, we propose Gradient Knowledge Distillation (GKD) to incorporate the gradient alignment objective into the distillation process. Experimental results show that GKD outperforms previous KD methods regarding student performance. Further analysis shows that incorporating gradient knowledge makes the student behave more consistently with the teacher, improving the interpretability greatly.", "label": 0}

Yet, few works investigated the impact on performance when the data properties substantially differ between the pre-training and fine-tuning phases, termed domain shift. We target this scenario by analyzing the robustness of Wav2Vec 2.0 and XLS-R models on downstream ASR for a completely unseen domain, air traffic control (ATC) communications. We benchmark these two models on several open-source and challenging ATC databases with signal-to-noise ratio between 5 and 20 dB. Relative word error rate (WER) reductions between 20% to 40% are obtained in comparison to hybrid-based ASR baselines by only fine-tuning E2E acoustic models with a smaller fraction of labeled data.

However, popular VLMs usually consist of hundreds of millions of parameters which brings challenges for fine-tuning and deployment in real-world applications due to space, memory, and latency constraints. In this work, we introduce a distilling then pruning framework to compress large vision-language models into smaller, faster, and more accurate ones. We first shrink the size of a pre-trained large VLM and apply knowledge distillation in the vision-language pre-training stage to obtain a task-agnostic compact VLM. Then we propose a modal-adaptive pruning algorithm to automatically infer the importance of vision and language modalities for different downstream tasks and adaptively remove redundant structures and neurons in different encoders with controllable target sparsity. We apply our framework to train EfficientVLM, a fast and accurate vision-language model consisting of 6 vision layers, 3 text layers, and 3 cross-modal fusion layers, accounting for only 93 million parameters in total, which is 44.3% of the teacher model. EfficientVLM retains 98.4% performance of the teacher model and accelerates its inference speed by 2.2x.

Dual-encoder models have a faster inference speed than fusion-encoder models and enable the pre-computation of images and text during inference. However, the shallow interaction module used in dual-encoder models is insufficient to handle complex vision-language understanding tasks. In order to learn deep interactions of images and text, we introduce cross-modal attention distillation, which uses the image-to-text and text-to-image attention distributions of a fusion-encoder model to guide the training of our dual-encoder model. In addition, we show that applying the cross-modal attention distillation for both pre-training and fine-tuning stages achieves further improvements. Experimental results demonstrate that the distilled dual-encoder model achieves competitive performance for visual reasoning, visual entailment and visual question answering tasks while enjoying a much faster inference speed than fusion-encoder models.

However, fake reviews can mislead both consumers and companies. Several models have been developed to detect fake reviews using machine learning approaches. Many of these models have some limitations resulting in low accuracy in distinguishing between fake and genuine reviews. These models focused only on linguistic features to detect fake reviews and failed to capture the semantic meaning of the reviews. To deal with this, this paper proposes a new ensemble model that employs transformer architecture to discover the hidden patterns in a sequence of fake reviews and detect them precisely. The proposed approach combines three transformer models to improve the robustness of fake and genuine behaviour profiling and modelling to detect fake reviews. The experimental results using semi-real benchmark datasets showed the superiority of the proposed model over state-of-the-art models.", "label": 0}

A reason, therefore, is that a QA system allows humans to interact more naturally with a machine, e.g., via a virtual assistant or search engine. In the last decades, many QA systems have been proposed to address the requirements of different question-answering tasks. Furthermore, many error scores have been introduced, e.g., based on n-gram matching, word embeddings, or contextual embeddings to measure the performance of a QA system. This survey attempts to provide a systematic overview of the general framework of QA, QA paradigms, benchmark datasets, and assessment techniques for a quantitative evaluation of QA systems. The latter is particularly important because not only is the construction of a QA system complex but also its evaluation. We hypothesize that a reason, therefore, is that the quantitative formalization of human judgment is an open problem.", "label": 0}

Surprisingly, we find that subword-based models might still be the most practical choice in many settings, achieving better performance for lower inference latency and memory usage. Based on these results, we encourage future work in tokenizer-free methods to consider these factors when designing and evaluating new models.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Adversarial Robustness of Representation Learning for Knowledge Graphs\nAuthors: Peru Bhardwaj\nAbstract: Knowledge graphs represent factual knowledge about the world as relationships between concepts and are critical for intelligent decision making in enterprise applications. New knowledge is inferred from the existing facts in the knowledge graphs by encoding the concepts and relations into low-dimensional feature vector representations. The most effective representations for this task, called Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE), are learned through neural network architectures. Due to their impressive predictive performance, they are increasingly used in high-impact domains like healthcare, finance and education. However, are the black-box KGE models adversarially robust for use in domains with high stakes? This thesis argues that state-of-the-art KGE models are vulnerable to data poisoning attacks, that is, their predictive performance can be degraded by systematically crafted perturbations to the training knowledge graph. To support this argument, two novel data poisoning attacks are proposed that craft input deletions or additions at training time to subvert the learned model's performance at inference time. These adversarial attacks target the task of predicting the missing facts in knowledge graphs using KGE models, and the evaluation shows that the simpler attacks are competitive with or outperform the computationally expensive ones. The thesis contributions not only highlight and provide an opportunity to fix the security vulnerabilities of KGE models, but also help to understand the black-box predictive behaviour of KGE models.", "label": 0}

A crucial part of writing is editing and revising the text. Previous works on text revision have focused on defining edit intention taxonomies within a single domain or developing computational models with a single level of edit granularity, such as sentence-level edits, which differ from human's revision cycles. This work describes IteraTeR: the first large-scale, multi-domain, edit-intention annotated corpus of iteratively revised text. In particular, IteraTeR is collected based on a new framework to comprehensively model the iterative text revisions that generalize to various domains of formal writing, edit intentions, revision depths, and granularities. When we incorporate our annotated edit intentions, both generative and edit-based text revision models significantly improve automatic evaluations. Through our work, we better understand the text revision process, making vital connections between edit intentions and writing quality, enabling the creation of diverse corpora to support computational modeling of iterative text revisions.", "label": 0}

Recently, there has been notable growth in AMR parsing performance. However, most existing work focuses on improving the performance in the specific domain, ignoring the potential domain dependence of AMR parsing systems. To address this, we extensively evaluate five representative AMR parsers on five domains and analyze challenges to cross-domain AMR parsing. We observe that challenges to cross-domain AMR parsing mainly arise from the distribution shift of words and AMR concepts. Based on our observation, we investigate two approaches to reduce the domain distribution divergence of text and AMR features, respectively. Experimental results on two out-of-domain test sets show the superiority of our method.", "label": 0}

This task is challenging because the target knowledge tuples can reside in multiple parts and modalities of the document. Our proposed method ReSel decomposes this task into a two-stage procedure that first retrieves the most relevant paragraph/table and then selects the target entity from the retrieved component. For the high-level retrieval stage, ReSel designs a simple and effective feature set, which captures multi-level lexical and semantic similarities between the query and components. For the low-level selection stage, ReSel designs a cross-modal entity correlation graph along with a multi-view architecture, which models both semantic and document-structural relations between entities. Our experiments on three scientific information extraction datasets show that ReSel outperforms state-of-the-art baselines significantly.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: FF2: A Feature Fusion Two-Stream Framework for Punctuation Restoration\nAuthors: Yangjun Wu, Kebin Fang, Yao Zhao, Hao Zhang, Lifeng Shi, Mengqi Zhang\nAbstract: To accomplish punctuation restoration, most existing methods focus on introducing extra information (e.g., part-of-speech) or addressing the class imbalance problem. Recently, large-scale transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMS) have been utilized widely and obtained remarkable success. However, the PLMS are trained on the large dataset with marks, which may not fit well with the small dataset without marks, causing the convergence to be not ideal. In this study, we propose a Feature Fusion two-stream framework (FF2) to bridge the gap. Specifically, one stream leverages a pre-trained language model to capture the semantic feature, while another auxiliary module captures the feature at hand. We also modify the computation of multi-head attention to encourage communication among heads. Then, two features with different perspectives are aggregated to fuse information and enhance context awareness. Without additional data, the experimental results on the popular benchmark IWSLT demonstrate that FF2 achieves new SOTA performance, which verifies that our approach is effective.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Adapters for Enhanced Modeling of Multilingual Knowledge and Text\nAuthors: Yifan Hou, Wenxiang Jiao, Meizhen Liu, Carl Allen, Zhaopeng Tu, Mrinmaya Sachan\nAbstract: Large language models appear to learn facts from the large text corpora they are trained on. Such facts are encoded implicitly within their many parameters, making it difficult to verify or manipulate what knowledge has been learned. Language models have recently been extended to multilingual language models (MLLMs), enabling knowledge to be learned across hundreds of languages. Meanwhile, knowledge graphs contain facts in an explicit triple format, which require careful and costly curation and are only available in a few high-resource languages, restricting their research and application. To address these issues, we propose to enhance MLLMs with knowledge from multilingual knowledge graphs (MLKGs) so as to tackle language and knowledge graph tasks across many languages, including low-resource ones. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight adapter set to enhance MLLMs with cross-lingual entity alignment and facts from MLKGs for many languages. Experiments on common benchmarks show that such enhancement benefits both MLLMs and MLKGs, achieving: (1) comparable or improved performance for knowledge graph completion and entity alignment relative to baselines, especially for low-resource languages (for which knowledge graphs are unavailable); and (2) improved MLLM performance on language understanding tasks that require multilingual factual knowledge; all while maintaining performance on other general language tasks.", "label": 0}

First, we establish that the test loss of encoder-decoder transformer models scales as a power law in the number of training samples, with a dependence on the model size. Then, we systematically vary aspects of the training setup to understand how they impact the data scaling laws. In particular, we change the following (1) Architecture and task setup: We compare to a transformer-LSTM hybrid, and a decoder-only transformer with a language modeling loss (2) Noise level in the training distribution: We experiment with filtering, and adding iid synthetic noise. In all the above cases, we find that the data scaling exponents are minimally impacted, suggesting that marginally worse architectures or training data can be compensated for by adding more data. Lastly, we find that using back-translated data instead of parallel data, can significantly degrade the scaling exponent.", "label": 0}

This lack of labeled data has led to the rise of low-resource methods, that assume low data availability in natural language processing. Among them, zero-shot learning stands out, which consists of learning a classifier without any previously labeled data. The best results reported with this approach use language models such as Transformers, but fall into two problems: high execution time and inability to handle long texts as input. This paper proposes a new model, ZeroBERTo, which leverages an unsupervised clustering step to obtain a compressed data representation before the classification task. We show that ZeroBERTo has better performance for long inputs and shorter execution time, outperforming XLM-R by about 12% in the F1 score in the FolhaUOL dataset.

This occurs, typically, due to classifiers overemphasizing source-specific information that negatively impacts its domain invariance. Prior work has attempted to penalize terms related to hate-speech from manually curated lists using feature attribution methods, which quantify the importance assigned to input terms by the classifier when making a prediction. We, instead, propose a domain adaptation approach that automatically extracts and penalizes source-specific terms using a domain classifier, which learns to differentiate between domains, and feature-attribution scores for hate-speech classes, yielding consistent improvements in cross-domain evaluation.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Cross-Align: Modeling Deep Cross-lingual Interactions for Word Alignment\nAuthors: Siyu Lai, Zhen Yang, Fandong Meng, Yufeng Chen, Jinan Xu, Jie Zhou\nAbstract: Word alignment which aims to extract lexicon translation equivalents between source and target sentences, serves as a fundamental tool for natural language processing. Recent studies in this area have yielded substantial improvements by generating alignments from contextualized embeddings of the pre-trained multilingual language models. However, we find that the existing approaches capture few interactions between the input sentence pairs, which degrades the word alignment quality severely, especially for the ambiguous words in the monolingual context. To remedy this problem, we propose Cross-Align to model deep interactions between the input sentence pairs, in which the source and target sentences are encoded separately with the shared self-attention modules in the shallow layers, while cross-lingual interactions are explicitly constructed by the cross-attention modules in the upper layers. Besides, to train our model effectively, we propose a two-stage training framework, where the model is trained with a simple Translation Language Modeling (TLM) objective in the first stage and then finetuned with a self-supervised alignment objective in the second stage. Experiments show that the proposed Cross-Align achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on four out of five language pairs.", "label": 0}

One of the most important components of SI is feature extraction, which has a substantial impact on the SI process and performance. As a result, numerous feature extraction strategies are thoroughly investigated, contrasted, and analyzed. This article exploits five distinct feature extraction methods for speaker identification in disguised voices under emotional environments.

{"text": "Title: Finding Dataset Shortcuts with Grammar Induction\nAuthors: Dan Friedman, Alexander Wettig, Danqi Chen\nAbstract: Many NLP datasets have been found to contain shortcuts: simple decision rules that achieve surprisingly high accuracy. However, it is difficult to discover shortcuts automatically. Prior work on automatic shortcut detection has focused on enumerating features like unigrams or bigrams, which can find only low-level shortcuts, or relied on post-hoc model interpretability methods like saliency maps, which reveal qualitative patterns without a clear statistical interpretation. In this work, we propose to use probabilistic grammars to characterize and discover shortcuts in NLP datasets. Specifically, we use a context-free grammar to model patterns in sentence classification datasets and use a synchronous context-free grammar to model datasets involving sentence pairs. The resulting grammars reveal interesting shortcut features in a number of datasets, including both simple and high-level features, and automatically identify groups of test examples on which conventional classifiers fail. Finally, we show that the features we discover can be used to generate diagnostic contrast examples and incorporated into standard robust optimization methods to improve worst-group accuracy.", "label": 0}

Label smoothing redistributes some observed probability mass over unobserved instances, often uniformly, uninformed of the true distribution. In contrast, we propose knowledge distillation for informed labeling, without incurring high computation overheads at evaluation time. Our contribution is designing a simple but efficient teacher model which utilizes collective knowledge, to outperform state-of-the-arts distilled from a more complex teacher model.

Smartphone keyboards typically support features such as input decoding, corrections and predictions that all rely on language models. For latency reasons, these operations happen on device, so the models are of limited size and cannot easily cover all the words needed by users for their daily tasks, especially in morphologically rich languages. In particular, the compounding nature of Germanic languages makes their vocabulary virtually infinite. Similarly, heavily inflecting and agglutinative languages (e.g. Slavic, Turkic or Finno-Ugric languages) tend to have much larger vocabularies than morphologically simpler languages, such as English or Mandarin. We propose to model such languages with automatically selected subword units annotated with what we call binding types, allowing the decoder to know when to bind subword units into words. We show that this method brings around 20% word error rate reduction in a variety of compounding languages. This is more than twice the improvement we previously obtained with a more basic approach, also described in the paper.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Monte Carlo Tree Search for Interpreting Stress in Natural Language\nAuthors: Kyle Swanson, Joy Hsu, Mirac Suzgun\nAbstract: Natural language processing can facilitate the analysis of a person's mental state from text they have written. Previous studies have developed models that can predict whether a person is experiencing a mental health condition from social media posts with high accuracy. Yet, these models cannot explain why the person is experiencing a particular mental state. In this work, we present a new method for explaining a person's mental state from text using Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). Our MCTS algorithm employs trained classification models to guide the search for key phrases that explain the writer's mental state in a concise, interpretable manner. Furthermore, our algorithm can find both explanations that depend on the particular context of the text (e.g., a recent breakup) and those that are context-independent. Using a dataset of Reddit posts that exhibit stress, we demonstrate the ability of our MCTS algorithm to identify interpretable explanations for a person's feeling of stress in both a context-dependent and context-independent manner.", "label": 0}

Recently, many attempts have tried to solve this problem via fine-tuning the pre-trained masked language models (MLMs) in order to obtain a better acronym representation. However, the acronym meaning is varied under different contexts, whose corresponding phrase representation mapped in different directions lacks discrimination in the entire vector space. Thus, the original representations of the pre-trained MLMs are not ideal for the acronym disambiguation task. In this paper, we propose a Simple framework for Contrastive Learning of Acronym Disambiguation (SimCLAD) method to better understand the acronym meanings. Specifically, we design a continual contrastive pre-training method that enhances the pre-trained model's generalization ability by learning the phrase-level contrastive distributions between true meaning and ambiguous phrases. The results on the acronym disambiguation of the scientific domain in English show that the proposed method outperforms all other competitive state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.", "label": 0}

As one of its core components, the softmax attention helps to capture long-range dependencies yet prohibits its scale-up due to the quadratic space and time complexity to the sequence length. Kernel methods are often adopted to reduce the complexity by approximating the softmax operator. Nevertheless, due to the approximation errors, their performances vary in different tasks/corpus and suffer crucial performance drops when compared with the vanilla softmax attention. In this paper, we propose a linear transformer called cosFormer that can achieve comparable or better accuracy to the vanilla transformer in both casual and cross attentions. cosFormer is based on two key properties of softmax attention: i). non-negativeness of the attention matrix; ii). a non-linear re-weighting scheme that can concentrate the distribution of the attention matrix. As its linear substitute, cosFormer fulfills these properties with a linear operator and a cosine-based distance re-weighting mechanism. Extensive experiments on language modeling and text understanding tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. We further examine our method on long sequences and achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Long-Range Arena benchmark.

{"text": "Title: Joint Reasoning on Hybrid-knowledge sources for Task-Oriented Dialog\nAuthors: Mayank Mishra, Danish Contractor, Dinesh Raghu\nAbstract: Traditional systems designed for task oriented dialog utilize knowledge present only in structured knowledge sources to generate responses. However, relevant information required to generate responses may also reside in unstructured sources, such as documents. Recent state of the art models such as HyKnow and SeKnow aimed at overcoming these challenges make limiting assumptions about the knowledge sources. For instance, these systems assume that certain types of information, such as a phone number, is always present in a structured KB while information about aspects such as entrance ticket prices would always be available in documents.   In this paper, we create a modified version of the MutliWOZ based dataset prepared by SeKnow to demonstrate how current methods have significant degradation in performance when strict assumptions about the source of information are removed. Then, in line with recent work exploiting pre-trained language models, we fine-tune a BART based model using prompts for the tasks of querying knowledge sources, as well as, for response generation, without making assumptions about the information present in each knowledge source. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that our model is robust to perturbations to knowledge modality (source of information), and that it can fuse information from structured as well as unstructured knowledge to generate responses.", "label": 0}

We study interactive weakly-supervised learning -- the problem of iteratively and automatically discovering novel labeling rules from data to improve the WSL model. Our proposed model, named PRBoost, achieves this goal via iterative prompt-based rule discovery and model boosting. It uses boosting to identify large-error instances and then discovers candidate rules from them by prompting pre-trained LMs with rule templates. The candidate rules are judged by human experts, and the accepted rules are used to generate complementary weak labels and strengthen the current model. Experiments on four tasks show PRBoost outperforms state-of-the-art WSL baselines up to 7.1% and bridges the gaps with fully supervised models.

Previous methods either generate logical forms that can be executed over KBs to obtain final answers or predict answers directly. Empirical results show that the former often produces more accurate answers, but it suffers from non-execution issues due to potential syntactic and semantic errors in the generated logical forms. In this work, we propose a novel framework DecAF that jointly generates both logical forms and direct answers, and then combines the merits of them to get the final answers. Moreover, different from most of the previous methods, DecAF is based on simple free-text retrieval without relying on any entity linking tools -- this simplification eases its adaptation to different datasets.

Recently, many MDTC methods adopt adversarial learning, shared-private paradigm, and entropy minimization to yield state-of-the-art results. However, these approaches face three issues: (1) Minimizing domain divergence can not fully guarantee the success of domain alignment; (2) Aligning marginal feature distributions can not fully guarantee the discriminability of the learned features; (3) Standard entropy minimization may make the predictions on unlabeled data over-confident, deteriorating the discriminability of the learned features. In order to address the above issues, we propose a co-regularized adversarial learning (CRAL) mechanism for MDTC. This approach constructs two diverse shared latent spaces, performs domain alignment in each of them, and punishes the disagreements of these two alignments with respect to the predictions on unlabeled data. Moreover, virtual adversarial training (VAT) with entropy minimization is incorporated to impose consistency regularization to the CRAL method. Experiments show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two MDTC benchmarks.", "label": 0}

However, this approach struggles as the task complexity increases or when the individual reasoning steps of the task themselves are hard to learn, especially when embedded in more complex tasks. To address this, we propose Decomposed Prompting, a new approach to solve complex tasks by decomposing them (via prompting) into simpler sub-tasks that can be delegated to a library of prompting-based LLMs dedicated to these sub-tasks. This modular structure allows each prompt to be optimized for its specific sub-task, further decomposed if necessary, and even easily replaced with more effective prompts, trained models, or symbolic functions if desired. We show that the flexibility and modularity of Decomposed Prompting allows it to outperform prior work on few-shot prompting using GPT3. On symbolic reasoning tasks, we can further decompose sub-tasks that are hard for LLMs into even simpler solvable sub-tasks. When the complexity comes from the input length, we can recursively decompose the task into the same task but with smaller inputs. We also evaluate our approach on textual multi-step reasoning tasks: on long-context multi-hop QA task, we can more effectively teach the sub-tasks via our separate sub-tasks prompts; and on open-domain multi-hop QA, we can incorporate a symbolic information retrieval within our decomposition framework, leading to improved performance on both tasks.", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Hyperbolic Disentangled Representation for Fine-Grained Aspect Extraction\nAuthors: Chang-You Tai, Ming-Yao Li, Lun-Wei Ku\nAbstract: Automatic identification of salient aspects from user reviews is especially useful for opinion analysis. There has been significant progress in utilizing weakly supervised approaches, which require only a small set of seed words for training aspect classifiers. However, there is always room for improvement. First, no weakly supervised approaches fully utilize latent hierarchies between words. Second, each seed words representation should have different latent semantics and be distinct when it represents a different aspect. In this paper, we propose HDAE, a hyperbolic disentangled aspect extractor in which a hyperbolic aspect classifier captures words latent hierarchies, and aspect-disentangled representation models the distinct latent semantics of each seed word. Compared to previous baselines, HDAE achieves average F1 performance gains of 18.2% and 24.1% on Amazon product review and restaurant review datasets, respectively. In addition, the em-bedding visualization experience demonstrates that HDAE is a more effective approach to leveraging seed words. An ablation study and a case study further attest to the effectiveness of the proposed components", "label": 0}
